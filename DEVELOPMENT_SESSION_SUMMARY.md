# CloudWorkstation Development Session Summary
*Session Date: June 17, 2025*

## Overview
Major development session focused on transforming CloudWorkstation from a simple VM launcher into a comprehensive research computing platform. Key achievements include enterprise-grade storage management, multi-stack template architecture, and advanced budget tracking systems.

## Major Features Implemented

### üóÑÔ∏è Complete Storage Management System
**EFS Volume Integration:**
- Full lifecycle management (create, list, info, delete)
- Automatic mounting with proper permissions during launch
- Safe deletion with mount target cleanup
- Cross-instance data sharing capabilities
- Integration with launch command: `cws launch template name --volume volume-name`

**EBS Secondary Volumes:**
- T-shirt sizing system (XS=100GB, S=500GB, M=1TB, L=2TB, XL=4TB)
- Support for gp3 and io2 volume types with automatic IOPS/throughput configuration
- Complete management commands (create, attach, detach, delete, list, info)
- Cost-transparent pricing with monthly estimates
- Multiple EBS volumes per instance support

**Code Changes:**
- Added EFSVolume and EBSVolume structs to main.go
- Enhanced Instance struct with AttachedVolumes and AttachedEBSVolumes fields
- Updated State struct to include Volumes and EBSVolumes maps
- Implemented comprehensive volume management functions
- Added EFS SDK dependency and client initialization

### üèóÔ∏è Multi-Stack Template Architecture Design
**Stackable Template System:**
- Designed base templates + application stacks approach
- Support for multiple package managers (Spack, Conda, Docker, Native)
- Smart defaults with power-user overrides
- Progressive disclosure: simple by default, advanced when needed

**Package Manager Strategy:**
- **Native**: GUI applications, system tools (best performance)
- **Spack**: HPC/scientific software (optimized builds, multiple versions)
- **Conda**: Python environments (familiar to researchers)
- **Docker**: Web services, isolated pipelines (when appropriate)

### üñ•Ô∏è NICE DCV Integration Design
**Desktop Environment Support:**
- Hardware-accelerated remote desktop for research applications
- Superior to RDP/VNC for scientific visualization
- GPU passthrough for rendering and ML workloads
- Desktop idle detection for cost management

**Research-Specific Templates Designed:**
- `scivis`: Scientific visualization (ParaView + VisIt + VTK)
- `gis-research`: GIS analysis (QGIS + GRASS + PostGIS)
- `cuda-ml`: CUDA ML (PyTorch + TensorFlow with GPU optimization)
- `neuroimaging`: Brain imaging (FSL + AFNI + ANTs + Neuroglancer)
- `desktop-research`: General research desktop with NICE DCV

### üí∞ Advanced Budget Tracking System Design
**Granular Cost Management:**
- Instance-level cost tracking with persistent storage awareness
- Multi-month project budgets (vs traditional monthly AWS budgets)
- Proactive cost controls with automatic idle detection
- Comprehensive tracking of EBS/EFS costs that continue when instances are stopped

**Smart Idle Detection:**
- Multi-signal detection (CPU, network, SSH sessions, GUI activity)
- Desktop-specific detection (mouse/keyboard, DCV sessions, screen lock)
- Research-aware logic (don't stop during ML training, long simulations)
- Graduated responses (warning ‚Üí recommendation ‚Üí auto-action)

## Technical Architecture Enhancements

### Enhanced Data Structures
```go
// New volume management structures
type EFSVolume struct {
    Name, FileSystemId, Region, State string
    CreationTime time.Time
    MountTargets []string
    PerformanceMode, ThroughputMode string
    EstimatedCostGB float64
    SizeBytes int64
}

type EBSVolume struct {
    Name, VolumeID, Region, State, VolumeType string
    CreationTime time.Time
    SizeGB, IOPS, Throughput int32
    EstimatedCostGB float64
    AttachedTo string
}

// Enhanced instance tracking
type Instance struct {
    // ... existing fields
    AttachedVolumes []string    // EFS volume names
    AttachedEBSVolumes []string // EBS volume IDs
}
```

### Storage Command Implementation
- `cws volume create|list|info|delete` - Complete EFS management
- `cws storage create|list|info|delete|attach|detach` - Complete EBS management
- Enhanced launch command with `--volume` and `--storage` flags
- Automatic volume mounting and configuration

### State Management Improvements
- Backward-compatible state file handling
- Enhanced error handling and validation
- Support for complex storage configurations
- Proper resource cleanup and conflict detection

## Design Decisions & Principles

### Multi-Package Manager Approach
**Key Insight:** Different researchers use different tools (Spack, Conda, Docker, Apptainer). Rather than forcing one approach, support multiple with smart defaults:
- Hide complexity behind simple templates
- Let CloudWorkstation choose the best tool for each component
- Allow power-user overrides when needed
- Progressive disclosure: start simple, add complexity when required

### Storage Strategy
**Persistent Storage Awareness:**
- EBS/EFS costs continue when instances are stopped
- Proper cost attribution across instance lifecycle
- Multiple volume types for different performance needs
- T-shirt sizing for user-friendly capacity selection

### NICE DCV for Research
**Superior Desktop Experience:**
- Hardware GPU acceleration for scientific visualization
- 4K/8K display support for high-resolution research
- Low latency for interactive work
- Cross-platform client support

## Roadmap Items Added

### Phase 2 (In Progress)
- ‚úÖ EFS/EBS volume management (implemented)
- üöß Multi-stack templates with Spack integration
- üöß NICE DCV desktop environments
- üöß Idle detection and cost controls

### Phase 3 (Advanced Features)
- Granular budget tracking with project-level management
- Hibernation support with properly sized root EBS volumes
- Snapshot management for reproducible research
- Local SSD support (i3/i4i instances) for ultra-high performance

### Phase 4 (Collaboration & Scale)
- Multi-user projects and shared workspaces
- Template marketplace for community contributions
- OpenZFS/FSx integration for specialized storage needs
- Multi-cloud support (AWS + Azure + GCP)

## Technical Debt & Future Considerations

### Implementation Priorities
1. **Complete current storage system** - Add EBS volume creation during launch
2. **Add Spack backend** - Hidden behind existing simple templates
3. **Implement budget tracking** - Instance-level cost monitoring
4. **Add NICE DCV templates** - Desktop research environments

### Architectural Considerations
- Template system needs refactoring for stackable architecture
- State management may need optimization for large numbers of volumes
- Cost tracking requires CloudWatch integration
- Multi-package manager support needs careful dependency management

## Session Statistics
- **Lines of code added:** ~1,074 (primarily storage management)
- **New commands implemented:** 12 (volume and storage management)
- **Design documents created:** Comprehensive multi-stack architecture
- **Roadmap items defined:** 15+ with clear prioritization

## Next Development Focus
1. Complete EBS volume integration with launch command
2. Implement basic Spack backend (hidden from users)
3. Add NICE DCV desktop template
4. Begin budget tracking system implementation

This session establishes CloudWorkstation as a serious research computing platform capable of competing with dedicated research cloud services while maintaining its core simplicity and "Default to Success" philosophy.
