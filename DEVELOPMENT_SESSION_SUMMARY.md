**Research-Specific Templates Designed:**
- `scivis`: Scientific visualization (ParaView + VisIt + VTK)
- `gis-research`: GIS analysis (QGIS + GRASS + PostGIS)
- `cuda-ml`: CUDA ML (PyTorch + TensorFlow with GPU optimization)
- `neuroimaging`: Brain imaging (FSL + AFNI + ANTs + Neuroglancer)
- `desktop-research`: General research desktop with NICE DCV

### üí∞ Advanced Budget Tracking System Design
**Granular Cost Management:**
- Instance-level cost tracking with persistent storage awareness
- Multi-month project budgets (vs traditional monthly AWS budgets)
- Proactive cost controls with automatic idle detection
- Comprehensive tracking of EBS/EFS costs that continue when instances are stopped

**Smart Idle Detection:**

- Desktop-specific detection (mouse/keyboard, DCV sessions, screen lock)
- Research-aware logic (don't stop during ML training, long simulations)
- Graduated responses (warning ‚Üí recommendation ‚Üí auto-action)

## Technical Architecture Enhancements

### Enhanced Data Structures
```go
// New volume management structures
type EFSVolume struct {
    Name, FileSystemId, Region, State string
    CreationTime time.Time
    MountTargets []string
    PerformanceMode, ThroughputMode string
    EstimatedCostGB float64
    SizeBytes int64
}

type EBSVolume struct {
    Name, VolumeID, Region, State, VolumeType string
    CreationTime time.Time
    SizeGB, IOPS, Throughput int32
    EstimatedCostGB float64
    AttachedTo string
}

// Enhanced instance tracking
type Instance struct {
    // ... existing fields
    AttachedVolumes []string    // EFS volume names
    AttachedEBSVolumes []string // EBS volume IDs
}
```

### Storage Command Implementation
- `cws volume create|list|info|delete` - Complete EFS management
- `cws storage create|list|info|delete|attach|detach` - Complete EBS management
- Enhanced launch command with `--volume` and `--storage` flags
- Automatic volume mounting and configuration

### State Management Improvements
- Backward-compatible state file handling
- Enhanced error handling and validation
- Support for complex storage configurations
- Proper resource cleanup and conflict detection

## Design Decisions & Principles

### Multi-Package Manager Approach
**Key Insight:** Different researchers use different tools (Spack, Conda, Docker, Apptainer). Rather than forcing one approach, support multiple with smart defaults:
- Hide complexity behind simple templates
- Let CloudWorkstation choose the best tool for each component
- Allow power-user overrides when needed
- Progressive disclosure: start simple, add complexity when required

### Storage Strategy
**Persistent Storage Awareness:**
- EBS/EFS costs continue when instances are stopped
- Proper cost attribution across instance lifecycle
- Multiple volume types for different performance needs
- T-shirt sizing for user-friendly capacity selection

### NICE DCV for Research
**Superior Desktop Experience:**
- Hardware GPU acceleration for scientific visualization
- 4K/8K display support for high-resolution research
- Low latency for interactive work
- Cross-platform client support

## Roadmap Items Added

### Phase 2 (In Progress)
- ‚úÖ EFS/EBS volume management (implemented)
- üöß Multi-stack templates with Spack integration

## Major Architectural Transformation: Phase 1 Complete

### üèóÔ∏è **MILESTONE: Monolithic ‚Üí Distributed Architecture**
Successfully completed Phase 1 of the GUI architecture plan: split monolithic application into backend daemon + API client architecture. This represents a fundamental transformation from a single-file CLI tool to a proper distributed system ready for GUI development.

**New Architecture:**
```
cmd/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cws/          # CLI client binary
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ cwsd/         # Backend daemon binary

pkg/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ api/          # API client interface
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ daemon/       # Daemon core logic
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ aws/          # AWS operations (placeholder)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ state/        # State management
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ types/        # Shared types

internal/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ cli/          # CLI application logic
```

**What Works:**
- ‚úÖ Backend daemon with REST API server
- ‚úÖ Thin CLI client with all commands
- ‚úÖ Complete API interface definition
- ‚úÖ Proper state management abstraction
- ‚úÖ Build system with Makefile
- ‚úÖ Cross-platform release builds
- ‚úÖ Identical user experience to monolithic version

**API Endpoints Implemented:**
- `/api/v1/ping` - Health check
- `/api/v1/status` - Daemon status
- `/api/v1/instances/*` - Instance management
- `/api/v1/templates/*` - Template operations
- `/api/v1/volumes/*` - EFS volume management
- `/api/v1/storage/*` - EBS storage management

**Build System:**
- `make build` - Build both binaries
- `make install` - System installation
- `make release` - Multi-platform builds
- `make dev-daemon` - Development mode

### üéØ **Ready for Phase 2: GUI Development**
The architectural foundation is now in place for the GUI implementation. The daemon provides a complete REST API that any client (CLI, GUI, web) can use. The progressive disclosure design can now be implemented as a separate GUI client.

## Next Development Focus
**Phase 2: Basic GUI Development**
1. Extract actual AWS operations from main.go to aws package
2. Implement basic menubar/system tray GUI client
3. Complete EBS volume integration with launch command
4. Add background state sync between daemon and clients

**Phase 3: Advanced Features**
1. Implement basic Spack backend (hidden from users)
2. Add NICE DCV desktop template
3. Begin budget tracking system implementation
4. Add idle detection and cost controls

This session establishes CloudWorkstation as a serious research computing platform with modern distributed architecture, capable of competing with dedicated research cloud services while maintaining its core simplicity and "Default to Success" philosophy.
