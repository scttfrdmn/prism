## What is CloudWorkstation?

CloudWorkstation is an **enterprise research management platform** that allows academic researchers to launch pre-configured cloud research environments in **seconds** rather than spending **hours** setting up research computing infrastructure.

From individual researchers to institutional deployments, CloudWorkstation scales seamlessly while maintaining the simplicity that makes research computing accessible to everyone.

## üéØ Core Design Principles

- **üéØ Default to Success**: Every template works out of the box in every supported region
- **‚ö° Optimize by Default**: Smart instance sizing and cost-performance optimization  
- **üîç Transparent Fallbacks**: Clear communication when configurations change
- **üí° Helpful Warnings**: Gentle guidance for optimal choices
- **üö´ Zero Surprises**: Users always know what they're getting
- **üìà Progressive Disclosure**: Simple by default, detailed when needed

## üöÄ Quick Start

### macOS Installation

**üçé DMG Installer (Recommended for Desktop Users)**

```bash
# Download and install via DMG
curl -L -O https://github.com/scttfrdmn/cloudworkstation/releases/latest/download/CloudWorkstation-v0.4.2.dmg
open CloudWorkstation-v0.4.2.dmg
# Drag CloudWorkstation.app to Applications folder
```

**Features:** Native macOS app, GUI + CLI, automatic PATH setup, daemon auto-start
**Guide:** [macOS DMG Installation Guide](docs/MACOS_DMG_INSTALLATION.md)

**üì¶ Homebrew (Traditional)**

```bash
# Add the CloudWorkstation tap
brew tap scttfrdmn/cloudworkstation

# Install CloudWorkstation  
brew install cloudworkstation

# Verify installation
cws --version
```

### Linux/Other Platforms

```bash
# Download binary for your platform
curl -L https://github.com/scttfrdmn/cloudworkstation/releases/latest/download/cloudworkstation-linux-$(uname -m).tar.gz | tar xz

# Make executable and add to PATH
chmod +x cws cwsd
sudo mv cws cwsd /usr/local/bin/
```

### AWS Setup (Required)

Before launching workstations, you need to configure AWS credentials:

```bash
# Method 1: CloudWorkstation Profiles (Recommended)
aws configure --profile aws                    # Configure AWS CLI
cws profiles add personal my-research \
  --aws-profile aws --region us-west-2         # Create CWS profile
cws profiles switch aws                        # Activate profile

# Method 2: Environment Variables  
aws configure --profile aws
export AWS_PROFILE=aws                         # Point to your profile
```

**‚Üí For complete AWS setup guide:** [AWS_SETUP_GUIDE.md](AWS_SETUP_GUIDE.md)

### Your First Workstation

```bash
# Start the daemon
cws daemon start

# Launch a Python ML workstation  
cws launch "Python Machine Learning (Simplified)" my-research

# Connect to your workstation
cws connect my-research

# When done, hibernate to save costs (preserves state)
cws hibernate my-research
```

**That's it!** CloudWorkstation handles everything else automatically.
