## What is CloudWorkstation?

CloudWorkstation is an **academic research computing platform** that provides researchers with pre-configured cloud environments for data analysis, machine learning, and computational research.

From individual researchers to institutional deployments, CloudWorkstation scales seamlessly while maintaining the simplicity that makes research computing accessible to everyone.

## üéØ Core Design Principles

- **üéØ Default to Success**: Every template works out of the box in every supported region
- **‚ö° Optimize by Default**: Smart instance sizing and cost-performance optimization  
- **üîç Transparent Fallbacks**: Clear communication when configurations change
- **üí° Helpful Warnings**: Gentle guidance for optimal choices
- **üö´ Zero Surprises**: Users always know what they're getting
- **üìà Progressive Disclosure**: Simple by default, detailed when needed

## üöÄ Quick Start - Zero Setup Experience

### ‚ú® The CloudWorkstation Promise

**Zero setup, maximum productivity.** CloudWorkstation automatically handles:
- üöÄ **Daemon auto-start**: No manual service management needed
- üîë **Smart credential discovery**: Finds your AWS credentials automatically
- üåç **Intelligent region selection**: Uses your default AWS region
- üì¶ **Template validation**: Ensures all templates work in your region
- üîß **Automatic fallbacks**: Seamlessly handles unavailable resources

### macOS Installation

**üçé DMG Installer (Recommended for Desktop Users)**

```bash
# Download and install via DMG
curl -L -O https://github.com/scttfrdmn/cloudworkstation/releases/latest/download/CloudWorkstation-v0.4.5.dmg
open CloudWorkstation-v0.4.5.dmg
# Drag CloudWorkstation.app to Applications folder
```

**Features:** Native macOS app, GUI + CLI, automatic PATH setup, daemon auto-start
**Guide:** [macOS DMG Installation Guide](docs/MACOS_DMG_INSTALLATION.md)

**üì¶ Homebrew (Traditional)**

```bash
# Add the CloudWorkstation tap
brew tap scttfrdmn/cloudworkstation

# Install CloudWorkstation  
brew install cloudworkstation

# Verify installation
cws --version
```

### Linux Enterprise Distributions

**üêß Native Package Installation (Recommended for Servers)**

**Ubuntu/Debian:**
```bash
# Download and install DEB package
wget https://github.com/scttfrdmn/cloudworkstation/releases/latest/download/cloudworkstation_0.4.5-1_amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i cloudworkstation_0.4.5-1_amd64.deb
sudo apt-get install -f  # Fix any dependency issues

# Start service
sudo systemctl enable --now cloudworkstation
```

**RHEL/CentOS/Fedora:**
```bash
# Download and install RPM package  
wget https://github.com/scttfrdmn/cloudworkstation/releases/latest/download/cloudworkstation-0.4.5-1.x86_64.rpm
sudo dnf install cloudworkstation-0.4.5-1.x86_64.rpm

# Start service
sudo systemctl enable --now cloudworkstation
```

**Features:** Native systemd service, automatic startup, enterprise-grade security, comprehensive logging
**Guide:** [Linux Installation Guide](docs/LINUX_INSTALLATION.md)

### Linux/Other Platforms (Manual)

```bash
# Download binary for your platform
curl -L https://github.com/scttfrdmn/cloudworkstation/releases/latest/download/cloudworkstation-linux-$(uname -m).tar.gz | tar xz

# Make executable and add to PATH
chmod +x cws cwsd
sudo mv cws cwsd /usr/local/bin/
```

### AWS Credentials - Automatic Discovery

CloudWorkstation automatically discovers your AWS credentials in this order:

1. **Environment variables** (AWS_PROFILE, AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, etc.)
2. **AWS CLI configuration** (~/.aws/credentials)
3. **CloudWorkstation profiles** (for multi-account management)

```bash
# Option 1: Already have AWS CLI? You're done!
# CloudWorkstation will use your existing credentials

# Option 2: Need to set up AWS?
aws configure  # Follow prompts for access key and region

# Option 3: Multiple AWS accounts? Use profiles
cws profiles add research --aws-profile research-account --region us-west-2
cws profiles switch research
```

**‚Üí Advanced setup options:** [AWS_SETUP_GUIDE.md](AWS_SETUP_GUIDE.md)

### Your First Workstation - Zero Configuration Required

```bash
# Launch a Python ML workstation - that's it!
cws launch "Python Machine Learning (Simplified)" my-research

# What happens automatically:
# ‚úÖ Daemon starts if not running
# ‚úÖ AWS credentials discovered from ~/.aws/credentials
# ‚úÖ Default region selected from AWS config
# ‚úÖ Optimal instance type chosen for ML workload
# ‚úÖ Template validated for your region
# ‚úÖ Security groups and networking configured
# ‚úÖ SSH keys generated and managed

# Connect to your workstation
cws connect my-research

# When done, use idle policy to save costs (preserves state)
cws idle policy apply my-research balanced
```

**That's it!** No configuration files, no setup scripts, no manual steps.
