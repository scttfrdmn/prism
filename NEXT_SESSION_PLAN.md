- ✅ Quick actions for common operations

#### 3. Visual Design System
- ✅ Consistent design system documentation
- ✅ Theme and color palette implementation
- ✅ Custom widgets for status display and cost monitoring
- ✅ Responsive layouts for different screen sizes

### Next Steps

#### 1. Package Manager Distribution (v0.4.2 - Week 2)
- [ ] Create Homebrew formula for macOS and Linux
- [ ] Develop Chocolatey package for Windows
- [ ] Configure Conda package for scientific computing communities
- [ ] Implement CI/CD pipeline for automated package updates

#### 2. Multi-Stack Template System (v0.4.2 - Week 3)
- [ ] Complete template dependency resolution system
- [ ] Implement template layering mechanism
- [ ] Add support for multiple package managers in templates
- [ ] Develop testing framework for template validation

#### 3. Complete Test Coverage (v0.4.2 - Week 4)
- [ ] Implement targeted unit tests for AWS resource management
- [ ] Add integration tests for daemon API endpoints
- [ ] Create CI workflow for coverage monitoring
- [ ] Document testing procedures for contributors

## Implementation Plan for Package Manager Distribution

### 1. Homebrew Formula Implementation (High Priority)
- [ ] Write formula with proper dependencies
- [ ] Set up tap repository for distribution
- [ ] Configure CI for automated updates

**Key Tasks:**
- Create a dedicated `scripts/homebrew` directory
- Write the Ruby formula file for Homebrew
- Create installation/upgrade scripts
- Set up versioning integration with main app
- Implement proper dependency management
- Establish a CI workflow for formula updates

### 2. Chocolatey Package for Windows (Medium Priority)
- [ ] Create package specification
- [ ] Set up package testing workflow
- [ ] Establish release verification process

### 3. Conda Package for Scientific Computing (Medium Priority)
- [ ] Design package for compatibility with research environments
- [ ] Test installation in standard research workflows
- [ ] Document conda-specific usage instructions

## Testing Commands for Next Session

### Testing Homebrew Installation
```bash
# Test local formula
brew install --formula ./scripts/homebrew/cloudworkstation.rb

# Test from tap
brew tap scttfrdmn/cloudworkstation https://github.com/scttfrdmn/homebrew-cloudworkstation
brew install scttfrdmn/cloudworkstation/cloudworkstation
```

### Testing Chocolatey Installation
```powershell
# Test local package
choco install -y ./scripts/chocolatey/cloudworkstation.nuspec

# Test from repository
choco install -y cloudworkstation --source="'https://package.cloudworkstation.org/chocolatey'"
```

### Testing Conda Installation
```bash
# Test local build
conda build ./scripts/conda
conda install --use-local cloudworkstation

# Test from channel
conda install cloudworkstation -c scttfrdmn
```

## Code Changes Summary

1. Added GUI testing framework:
   - `cmd/cws-gui/tests/`: Test suite for GUI components
   - `scripts/test_gui.sh`: Script for running GUI tests
   - `cmd/cws-gui/tests/testdata/`: Test fixtures for visual validation

2. Implemented system tray integration:
   - `cmd/cws-gui/systray/systray.go`: System tray functionality
   - Integration with main GUI application

3. Developed visual design system:
   - `cmd/cws-gui/theme/colors.go`: Theme and color palette
   - `cmd/cws-gui/widgets/`: Custom widgets for consistent UI
   - `cmd/cws-gui/widgets/responsive_layout.go`: Responsive layout system
   - `docs/GUI_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`: Design system documentation

4. Updated documentation:
   - `docs/GUI_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`: Implementation summary
   - `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_V0.4.2.md`: Updated with progress

## Next Session Starting Point

In the next session, we should focus on implementing the Homebrew formula for macOS and Linux distribution as part of the package manager distribution feature. This aligns with Week 2 of the v0.4.2 implementation plan.

## Implementation Approach

1. **Research Phase**
   - Review Homebrew formula requirements and best practices
   - Study similar Go application formulas (e.g., kubectl, hugo)
   - Identify potential dependencies and integration points

2. **Development Phase**
   - Create basic formula template
   - Implement build script integration
   - Add dependency management
   - Test installation and updates

3. **Testing Phase**
   - Test on macOS (Intel and Apple Silicon)
   - Test on Linux (Ubuntu, Fedora)
   - Verify upgrade paths
   - Validate dependencies

4. **Distribution Phase**
   - Create tap repository
   - Configure automated updates
   - Document installation process
   - Integrate with main documentation

## Outstanding Questions

1. Should we create desktop entry files (.desktop) for Linux GUI installations?
2. Do we need to automate package submission to official repositories?
3. How should we handle version syncing across different package managers?
4. Should we prioritize certain architectures or platforms for initial release?
