---

## Priority 2: HIGH - Infrastructure Completions (15-20 hours)

Core infrastructure that affects system reliability and functionality:

### 2.1 Connection Reliability Enhancements (MEDIUM IMPACT) ⭐⭐
**Files**: pkg/connection/reliability.go, daemon_client.go, manager.go
**Issues**:
- Line 291: "In production, you'd maintain a sliding window" (connection history)

### 2.2 Budget Tracker Notifications (MEDIUM IMPACT) ⭐⭐
**File**: pkg/project/budget_tracker.go:818, 831, 843
**Issues**: Email, Slack, webhook alerts currently just log

**Impact**: Budget alerts don't actually notify users - logs only
**Effort**: 6 hours (requires email/Slack/webhook integration)
**Priority**: MEDIUM - reduces budget alert effectiveness

### 2.3 Storage System Completions (LOW-MEDIUM IMPACT) ⭐
**Files**: pkg/storage/s3_manager.go, pkg/storage/fsx_manager.go (likely)
**Issues**: Additional storage optimizations and FSx mount commands

### 3.2 Idle Detection Cost Integration (LOW IMPACT) ⭐
**File**: pkg/daemon/idle_handlers.go:154
**Issue**: Cost tracking integration deferred

**Impact**: Idle cost tracking not integrated (marked as deferred)
**Effort**: 3 hours (once cost tracking implemented)
**Priority**: LOW - depends on cost tracking system

### 3.3 AWS Compliance Handlers (LOW IMPACT) ⭐
**File**: pkg/daemon/aws_compliance_handlers.go
**Issues**: Likely has placeholders for compliance checks

**Impact**: Compliance features simplified
**Effort**: 4 hours

## Priority 4: MARKETPLACE - DynamoDB Integration (25-30 hours)

Large architectural work for marketplace backend:

### 4.1 Marketplace DynamoDB Backend (HIGH COMPLEXITY) ⭐⭐
**File**: pkg/marketplace/registry.go
**Issues**: 15 placeholders - ALL marketplace operations use mock data

- Line 61: "In production, this would fetch from DynamoDB"
- Line 99: "For now, return based on recent downloads"
- Line 191: "In production, this would update DynamoDB"
- Plus 11 more DynamoDB integration points

**Impact**: MEDIUM - Marketplace functional with mock data, but not production-ready
**Effort**: 25 hours (requires DynamoDB schema design + implementation)
**Priority**: MEDIUM - Can defer to later phase if needed

**Note**: This is a Phase 6 feature - marketplace can work with local file storage for now

## Critical Path Dependencies

**Block 1**: Template System → Commercial Software Templates
- Template executor must work before commercial templates

**Block 2**: AMI System → Commercial Software Templates
- AMI discovery/override needed for commercial software

**Block 3**: Storage Completions → Directory Sync
- Storage foundation needed for sync system

**Block 4**: Policy Framework → Institutional Deployments
- Advanced policies enable institutional use cases

**Block 5**: All Implementations → AWS Integration Tests
- Cannot test what isn't implemented

---

## Notes

- **NO PLACEHOLDERS ALLOWED**: Every feature must be fully implemented
- **AWS Testing Required**: All implementations tested against real AWS (AWS_PROFILE=aws, AWS_REGION=us-west-2)
- **Feature Parity**: TUI and GUI must replicate all CLI functionality
- **Phase 5 Alignment**: Implement v0.5.3-0.5.5 roadmap features
- **Quality Over Speed**: No time pressure - completeness is the goal
