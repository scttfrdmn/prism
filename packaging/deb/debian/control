 CloudWorkstation is a command-line tool that allows academic researchers
 to launch pre-configured cloud workstations in seconds rather than spending
 hours setting up research environments.
 .
 Key features include:
  * Pre-configured templates for Python ML, R research, and more
  * Automated cost optimization with hibernation support
  * Multi-modal access: CLI, TUI, and GUI interfaces
  * Project-based budget management with real-time tracking
  * Enterprise-grade security and compliance features
  * Template inheritance and customization system
  * Comprehensive cost analytics with hibernation savings
 .
 This package provides both the command-line interface (cws) and the
 backend daemon (cwsd) with systemd integration for autonomous operation.
