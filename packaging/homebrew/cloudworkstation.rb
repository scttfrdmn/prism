    <<~EOS
      CloudWorkstation has been installed with three interfaces:
      
      Command Line Interface (CLI):
        cws --help
      
      Terminal User Interface (TUI):
        cws tui
      
      Graphical User Interface (GUI):
        cws-gui
      
      To get started:
        cws templates
        cws launch <template-name> <instance-name>
      
      The daemon (cwsd) will start automatically when needed.
      You can also start it manually or as a service.
      
      AWS credentials are required. Set them up with:
        aws configure
