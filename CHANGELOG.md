## [0.5.8] - TBD

### ðŸŽ¯ Focus: Billing Accuracy & Reliability

**Accurate Billing with StateTransitionReason Parsing**:
- >99.9% billing accuracy aligned with AWS rules
- Parse exact timestamp when instance enters "running" state
- New `RunningStateStartTime` field tracks billing start
- Smart fallbacks when StateTransitionReason unavailable
- Eliminates ~1-2% overcharging from pending state inclusion

### Added

  - StateTransitionReason parser for exact running-state timestamps
  - `RunningStateStartTime` field in Instance type
  - AWS billing rule compliance (only "running" state billed)
  - Intelligent fallback to estimated running start time

### Fixed
- **IAM Profile Eventual Consistency** (#TBD):
  - Poll for IAM profile readiness after creation
  - Exponential backoff retry (up to 10 attempts)
  - Eliminates launch failures for newly provisioned instances
  - Log feedback during IAM profile wait

- **GPU Instance Stop Timeouts**:
  - Extended timeout from 5 to 10 minutes
  - Separate `InstanceStopTimeout` constant
  - Accommodates slow GPU operations (g4dn.2xlarge)
  - Integration tests pass reliably

- **Terminated Instance Cleanup**:
  - Poll for 5 minutes until instance disappears
  - Handles AWS eventual consistency properly
