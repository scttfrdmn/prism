# CloudWorkstation Development TODOs

## High Priority - Critical Issues

### üö® Template System Validation
- [ ] **CRITICAL: Test sampling of normal templates for software install issues**
  - The idle detection template deployment issues suggest broader template UserData problems
  - Test key templates: R Research Environment, Python ML, Web Development
  - Validate that packages are installing correctly
  - Check UserData vs generated script conflicts
  - Ensure template inheritance system works with software installation

### üîÑ Idle Detection System Improvements
- [ ] **Test idle tag reset behavior on instance restart**
  - Verify that stopped/hibernated instances reset `IdleStatus` to `active` on restart
  - Test hibernated instance resume cycle
  - Validate cron job execution after system restart
  - Ensure agent survives reboot and continues monitoring

- [ ] **Agent Update and Versioning System**
  - Implement versioned agent deployment with semantic versioning
  - Create agent update mechanism for existing instances
  - Add version comparison and automatic update capabilities
  - Implement agent self-update via CloudWorkstation daemon push

- [ ] **AWS CLI Maintenance Automation**
  - Add periodic AWS CLI version checking (weekly cron job)
  - Implement automatic AWS CLI v2 updates on instances
  - Push updates to running instances via daemon
  - Track CLI versions across fleet for security and compatibility

### üé® User Experience Improvements  
- [ ] **Template Slug Names for CLI**
  - Add slug versions of template names with dashes (e.g., `r-research-env`) as **alternatives**
  - Support both display names and slugs for launch commands (user choice)
  - Update `cws list` to show both display name and slug for reference
  - Examples (both work):
    - `cws launch "R Research Environment" my-project` (existing)
    - `cws launch r-research-env my-project` (new slug alternative)
    - `cws launch "Idle Detection Test" my-test` (existing)  
    - `cws launch idle-detection-test my-test` (new slug alternative)

- [ ] **Enhanced Template Information**
  - Implement `cws templates info <name>` command for detailed template information
  - Show packages included, services configured, ports exposed
  - Display template inheritance chain and dependencies  
  - Include cost estimates and instance type recommendations
  - Show UserData preview and configuration options
  - Example output:
    ```
    Template: R Research Environment (r-research-env)
    Version: 1.2.0
    Description: R + RStudio Server + tidyverse packages
    
    Inherits: ubuntu-22.04-base

    Services:
      - RStudio Server (port 8787)
      - SSH (port 22)
      
    Instance Types: t3.medium (x86_64), t4g.medium (arm64)
