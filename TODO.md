# CloudWorkstation Development TODOs

## High Priority - Critical Issues

### üö® Template System Validation
- [ ] **CRITICAL: Test sampling of normal templates for software install issues**
  - The idle detection template deployment issues suggest broader template UserData problems
  - Test key templates: R Research Environment, Python ML, Web Development
  - Validate that packages are installing correctly
  - Check UserData vs generated script conflicts
  - Ensure template inheritance system works with software installation

### üîÑ Idle Detection System Improvements
- [ ] **Test idle tag reset behavior on instance restart**
  - Verify that stopped/hibernated instances reset `IdleStatus` to `active` on restart
  - Test hibernated instance resume cycle
  - Validate cron job execution after system restart
  - Ensure agent survives reboot and continues monitoring

- [ ] **Agent Update and Versioning System**
  - Implement versioned agent deployment with semantic versioning
  - Create agent update mechanism for existing instances
  - Add version comparison and automatic update capabilities
  - Implement agent self-update via CloudWorkstation daemon push

- [ ] **AWS CLI Maintenance Automation**
  - Add periodic AWS CLI version checking (weekly cron job)
  - Implement automatic AWS CLI v2 updates on instances
  - Push updates to running instances via daemon
  - Track CLI versions across fleet for security and compatibility

## Medium Priority - Feature Enhancements

### üß† Intelligent Idle Detection
- [ ] **Enhanced System Metrics**
  - GPU utilization monitoring (NVIDIA-SMI integration)
  - Network I/O activity thresholds
  - Disk I/O activity detection  
  - Memory usage pattern analysis
  - Process-specific monitoring (Jupyter, RStudio, Docker containers)

- [ ] **Research Domain Intelligence**
  - ML training job detection (long-running GPU processes)
  - Data analysis pattern recognition
  - Scheduled job awareness (cron, batch systems)
  - Domain-specific idle thresholds (ML vs data analysis vs web dev)

- [ ] **Hibernation Policy Optimization**
  - Machine learning-based hibernation vs stop decisions
  - Instance type-specific policies (GPU instances hibernate faster)
  - Cost-based decision making (hibernation vs stop cost analysis)
  - User preference learning and adaptation

### üë• Multi-User and Collaboration
- [ ] **Per-User Idle Detection**
  - Individual user activity tracking
  - Multi-user instance support
  - User-specific notification before actions
  - Collaborative instance management

- [ ] **Notification System**
  - Slack/Discord integration for idle warnings
  - Email notifications before hibernation/stop
  - Team notifications for shared instances
  - Cost savings reports and summaries

### üìä Analytics and Monitoring
- [ ] **Cost Analytics Integration**
  - Real-time savings calculation and reporting
  - Historical cost analysis (with vs without idle detection)
  - Per-project cost optimization metrics
  - Research group cost dashboards

- [ ] **Advanced Monitoring**
  - Web UI dashboard for idle detection status
  - Fleet-wide idle detection overview
  - Alert system for agent failures
  - Performance metrics and optimization suggestions

## Low Priority - Quality of Life

### üîß System Administration
- [ ] **Enhanced IAM Role Management**
  - Automatic IAM role updates and versioning
  - Cross-region IAM role synchronization
  - Role permission validation and health checks
  - Least-privilege principle enforcement

- [ ] **Template System Improvements** 
  - Template validation pipeline
  - Automated template testing
  - Template performance benchmarking

### üß™ Testing and Validation
- [ ] **Automated Testing Suite**
  - End-to-end idle detection integration tests
  - Template deployment validation tests
  - Cross-platform compatibility testing (x86_64 vs ARM64)
  - Performance regression testing

- [ ] **Documentation Improvements**
  - Interactive troubleshooting guides
  - Video tutorials for idle detection system
  - Research domain-specific guides
  - Cost optimization best practices

## Technical Debt

### üèóÔ∏è Architecture Improvements
- [ ] **Profile System Integration**
  - Better error handling for profile mismatches
  - Automatic profile detection and configuration
