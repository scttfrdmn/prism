# Instance-to-AMI Implementation Complete

## Overview

Successfully implemented the `cws save` command for converting running CloudWorkstation instances into reusable AMI templates. This addresses the critical researcher workflow of preserving customized environments for reuse and sharing.

## Implementation Summary

### Core Functionality
- **Command**: `cws save <instance-name> <template-name> [options]`
- **Safe Operation**: Temporarily stops instance → Creates AMI → Restarts instance automatically
- **Error Recovery**: Best-effort instance restart if any step fails
- **Template Generation**: Creates YAML template definition for immediate reuse

### Key Features Implemented

#### 1. CLI Integration
```bash
# Basic usage
cws save my-analysis custom-ml-env

# Advanced usage with options
cws save my-research genomics-pipeline \
  --description "Custom genomics analysis environment with GATK and R" \
  --copy-to-regions us-east-2,us-west-1 \
  --project brain-imaging-study \
  --public
```

#### 2. Multi-Region Support
- Automatically copies AMI to specified regions
- Registers copied AMIs in template registry
- Handles copy failures gracefully with detailed error reporting

#### 3. Template Registry Integration
- Automatically registers saved AMI in CloudWorkstation template system
- Creates YAML template definition for immediate launch capability
- Maintains metadata about original instance and creation details

#### 4. Enterprise Features
- **Project Integration**: Associates saved templates with projects (Phase 4)
- **Sharing Controls**: Public/private template sharing options
- **Audit Trail**: Full metadata tracking of saved templates

### Technical Architecture

#### 1. New Types (`pkg/ami/types.go`)
```go
type InstanceSaveRequest struct {
    InstanceID     string            // EC2 instance ID to save
    InstanceName   string            // CloudWorkstation instance name
    TemplateName   string            // Name for the new template
    Description    string            // Template description
    CopyToRegions  []string          // Regions to copy AMI
    Tags           map[string]string // Custom tags
    ProjectID      string            // Associated project (Phase 4)
    Public         bool              // Allow public sharing
}
```

#### 2. AMI Builder Extension (`pkg/ami/builder.go`)
```go
func (b *Builder) CreateAMIFromInstance(ctx context.Context, request InstanceSaveRequest) (*BuildResult, error)
```

**Implementation Steps**:
1. **Instance Validation**: Verify instance exists and is running
2. **Safe Stop**: Gracefully stop instance for consistent AMI creation
3. **AMI Creation**: Create AMI with comprehensive tagging
4. **Instance Restart**: Automatically restart original instance
5. **Registry Registration**: Register AMI in template system
6. **Multi-Region Copy**: Copy to additional regions if requested
7. **Template Definition**: Generate YAML template file

#### 3. CLI Command Handler (`internal/cli/ami.go`)
```go
func (a *App) handleAMISave(args []string) error
```

**Features**:
- API client integration for instance discovery
- User confirmation dialog with clear warnings
- Comprehensive option parsing
- Detailed progress reporting
- Professional error handling

### User Experience

#### Progress Reporting
```
💾 Saving instance 'my-analysis' as template 'custom-ml-env'
📍 Instance ID: i-1234567890abcdef0
🏷️  Description: Custom ML environment with optimized packages

⚠️  WARNING: Instance will be temporarily stopped to create a consistent AMI
   This ensures the AMI captures a clean state of the filesystem.
   The instance will be automatically restarted after AMI creation.

### Integration Points

#### 1. Main CLI (`cmd/cws/main.go`)
- Added `cws save` as top-level command
- Routes to `cws ami save` for implementation
- Updated help text and examples

#### 2. API Integration (`internal/cli/ami.go`)
- Uses daemon API client for instance discovery
- Maintains consistency with CloudWorkstation's API-driven architecture
- Proper error handling and user feedback

#### 3. Template System Integration

## Conclusion

The `cws save` command implementation transforms CloudWorkstation from a template-based system to a **living research platform** where environments can be preserved and shared at any point in their lifecycle. This addresses a critical gap in the research workflow and enables the community-driven template ecosystem envisioned for Phase 5.

The implementation maintains CloudWorkstation's core design principles:
- **Default to Success**: Safe operation with automatic error recovery
- **Zero Surprises**: Clear warnings and progress reporting
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Simple usage with advanced options available
- **Transparent Fallbacks**: Comprehensive error handling with clear messages

This feature enables researchers to build upon each other's work, creating a collaborative ecosystem of research environments that can be shared, improved, and reused across institutions and disciplines.
