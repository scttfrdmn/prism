- Enhanced template management with search and categorization
- Repository management for template sources

## v0.4.1: Graphical User Interface

### Phase 1: Core GUI Implementation
- System tray integration for always-available access
- Instance status monitoring and notifications in desktop environment
- Cost tracking and budget monitoring widgets
- Template browsing and launching interface
- Cross-platform implementation (macOS, Windows, Linux)

### Phase 2: Advanced GUI Features
- Visual resource monitoring dashboard
- Template customization interface
- Interactive cost projection tools
- Visual instance and storage management
- Instance connection shortcuts and management

## v0.5.0: Multi-User Collaboration Platform

### Phase 1: Access Control Foundation
- **IAM-based Owner and Group Management** (High Priority)
  - Owner(s) defined through IAM roles/users
  - Support for multiple administrators with equal rights
  - IAM group integration for team-based access
  - Hierarchical permission structure (owners > admins > users)
  - Ability to delegate specific administrative functions

- **Email-based Invitation System** (High Priority)
  - Secure token-based invitations
  - Configurable expiration dates
  - Owner ability to revoke access anytime
  - Audit logging for invitation/revocation events
  - AWS IAM integration for permission provisioning

### Phase 2: Resource Management
- **Resource Allocation Controls** (Medium Priority)
  - Instance type/size restrictions per user or group
  - Storage quota limitations for individual users
  - Region/availability zone restrictions
  - Maximum concurrent instance limits
  - Specialized resource access control (e.g., GPU instances)

- **Enhanced EFS Volume Access Controls** (High Priority)
  - Granular permissions: read-only, read-write, full access
  - Volume ownership and transferability
  - Volume sharing with specific users or groups
  - Mount-point specific permissions
  - Data lifecycle policies configurable by volume owners

### Phase 3: Advanced Budget Management
- **Time-based Budget Management** (High Priority)
  - Project-based budgets with configurable timeframes
  - Support for variable time periods (weeks, months, semesters)
  - Budget tracking across entire project lifecycle
  - Proactive notifications for budget thresholds
  - Historical spend analysis with projections

- **Invitee-specific Budget Allocation** (High Priority)
  - Assign individual budgets to specific users
  - Track and report spending per user
  - Set notification thresholds at user and project levels
  - Ability to adjust individual budgets as projects evolve
  - Option to freeze/suspend activity when budget is exceeded

## v0.6.0: Collaboration and Compliance

### Phase 1: Group Hierarchy and Organization
- **Hierarchical Group Management** (Medium Priority)
  - Support for nested groups and subgroups
  - Permission inheritance through group hierarchy
  - Cross-cutting group memberships (users in multiple groups)
  - Dynamic group assignment based on attributes
  - Delegation of group management to subgroup leaders
  - Project-based temporary groups with auto-expiration

- **Activity and Compliance Monitoring** (Medium Priority)
  - Comprehensive audit logging of all user actions
  - Automated compliance reporting for grant/funding requirements
  - Resource utilization analytics per user/group
  - Idle resource detection and notification at user level
  - Anomaly detection for unusual usage patterns

### Phase 2: Collaborative Workspaces
- **Shared Workspace Features** (Medium Priority)
  - Shared workspace management between team members
  - Data sharing controls and permissions
  - Workspace templates for standardized team environments
  - Metadata tagging for project organization
  - Shared cost allocation for collaborative resources

- **Advanced Budget Features** (Medium Priority)
  - Budget source tracking (grants, departments, projects)
  - Multi-currency support for international collaborations
  - Budget approval workflows for new resource requests
  - Automated cost optimization recommendations
  - Integration with institutional billing systems

## Future Roadmap (v0.7.0+)

### Specialized Templates
- **Cluster Head Node Template** (Low Priority)
  - Design for ephemeral compute node creation
  - Job scheduling and workload management
  - Auto-scaling based on computational demand
  - Cost-optimized instance selection for compute nodes
  - Integration with common HPC workloads

### Enhanced Security (Future Version)
- **Advanced Authentication** (Low Priority, pending user feedback)
  - Multi-factor authentication options
  - Session management and timeout controls
  - IP restriction capabilities
  - Integration with institutional SSO systems
  - Configurable security policies per group/project

## Implementation Approach

### Design Principles
All features will adhere to CloudWorkstation's core design principles:
- **Default to Success**: Smart defaults for optimal user experience
- **Optimize by Default**: Cost and resource optimization
- **Transparent Fallbacks**: Clear notifications for unavailable options
- **Helpful Warnings**: Proactive alerts for potential issues
- **Zero Surprises**: Preview operations and confirm destructive actions
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Simple by default, detailed when needed

### Development Priorities
1. Foundation features: IAM integration, invitation system
2. Budget and access control: Time-based budgets, EFS access
3. User and group management: Hierarchical groups, resource controls
4. Collaboration tools: Shared workspaces, compliance reporting

### Success Metrics
- User adoption rate for multi-user features
- Budget compliance rates for projects
- Resource utilization efficiency
- User satisfaction with collaboration tools
- Audit and compliance reporting effectiveness

This roadmap will be revisited regularly based on user feedback and evolving requirements.
