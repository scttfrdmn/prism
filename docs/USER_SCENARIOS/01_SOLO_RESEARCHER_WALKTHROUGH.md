# Scenario 1: Solo Researcher with Budget Constraints

## Persona: Dr. Sarah Chen

**Background**:
- Postdoctoral researcher in computational biology
- Personal research budget: $100/month from lab discretionary funds
- Works on RNA-seq analysis requiring sporadic compute (3-4 days/week)
- Primary concern: **Not going over budget** - needs to explain every dollar spent
- Technical level: Comfortable with command line, not a DevOps expert
- Works from laptop, often from home or coffee shops

**Pain Points**:
- Has accidentally left EC2 workspaces running overnight (cost $40 in one month!)
- Anxious about trying GPU workspaces (too expensive if forgotten)
- Needs to provide monthly cost reports to PI
- Current solution: Checks AWS billing dashboard obsessively, sets phone alarms to stop instances

---

## Current State (v0.5.5): What Works Today

### ✅ Initial Setup (Day 0)
```bash
# Install CloudWorkstation
brew install scttfrdmn/tap/cloudworkstation

# Start daemon and configure AWS
cws daemon start
cws profile create personal-research --aws-profile my-aws --region us-west-2

# Browse available templates
cws templates
```

**What Sarah sees**: 22 pre-configured templates with estimated costs
- `Python Machine Learning` - $1.20/day (t3.large)
- `R Research Environment` - $0.80/day (t3.medium)
- `Bioinformatics Suite` - $2.40/day (r5.xlarge - memory-optimized)

### ✅ Enable Hibernation (Cost Safety Net)
```bash
# Configure aggressive hibernation for budget safety
cws idle profile create budget-safe \
  --idle-minutes 15 \
  --action hibernate \
  --description "Hibernate after 15min idle - cost savings"

# Apply to future instances
cws idle profile set-default budget-safe
```

**Result**: Any workspace automatically hibernates after 15 minutes of inactivity
- Hibernation preserves RAM state (no lost work)
- Stops compute charges immediately
- Sarah can resume work exactly where she left off

### ✅ Launch First Workspace (Day 1)
```bash
# Launch bioinformatics workstation
cws launch bioinformatics-suite rnaseq-analysis --size M

# CloudWorkstation output:
# ✅ Workspace launching: rnaseq-analysis
# 📊 Estimated cost: $2.40/day ($72/month if running 24/7)
# ⚙️  Hibernation policy: budget-safe (15min idle)
# 🔗 SSH ready in ~90 seconds...
```

**What Sarah thinks**: *"Okay, $2.40/day... if I work 15 days this month, that's $36. That's within budget!"*

### ✅ Daily Work (Days 1-15)
```bash
# Morning: Resume work
cws list                    # See status: hibernated
cws start rnaseq-analysis   # Resume in 30 seconds
cws ssh rnaseq-analysis     # Start working

# Work session: 4 hours
# - Run RNA-seq pipeline
# - Hibernation policy watches: CPU, memory, disk activity
# - Sarah gets coffee, 15 minutes pass with no activity
# - Workspace automatically hibernates

# ✅ Hibernation triggered! Charges stop immediately
# 💰 Real-time savings: $2.40/hour → $0/hour
#    The money you're NOT spending is banked for future use!
#    Budget available increases in real-time as workspaces hibernate/stop

# Afternoon: Check costs
cws cost summary
# Output:
# Total monthly spend: $18.50
# Running instances: 0 (all hibernated)
# Hibernation savings: $24.30 (57% saved) ← THIS IS REAL MONEY BANKED!
# Available budget: $81.50 ($100 - $18.50)
# Projected month-end: $62 (within $100 budget ✅)
#
# 💡 Effective cost per hour: $0.31/hour (vs $2.40/hour if running 24/7)
#    You're paying for 60 hours of actual compute, not 360 hours!
#    That $24.30 savings? It's available RIGHT NOW for more work!
#
# 💡 Cloud vs Owned Reality:
#    Owned workstation: $3,000 upfront, depreciates whether you use it or not
#    CloudWorkstation: Pay $18.50 for 60 actual hours, bank the rest!
```

> **💡 GUI Note**: Cost summary is available in the GUI Dashboard (Costs tab) with visual charts - *coming soon in v0.6.0*

**What Sarah thinks**: *"The hibernation is working! Every time it hibernates, I'm banking money for future compute. I'm only paying $0.31/hour instead of $2.40/hour! No anxiety!"*

## ⚠️ Current Pain Points: What Doesn't Work

### ❌ Problem 1: No Budget Enforcement
**Scenario**: Week 3, Sarah accidentally launches GPU workspace

```bash
# Sarah tries GPU template for deep learning experiment
cws launch gpu-ml-workstation protein-folding --size L

# CloudWorkstation output:
# ✅ Workspace launching: protein-folding
# 📊 Estimated cost: $24.80/day ($744/month)
# 🔗 SSH ready in ~2 minutes...
```

**What should happen** (MISSING):
```
⚠️  WARNING: High-cost workspace detected!
   Estimated: $24.80/day ($744/month)
   Your monthly budget: $100
   This workspace will exceed your budget in 4 days.

   Continue? [y/N]: _
```

**Current workaround**: Sarah has to remember to check costs manually
**Risk**: One forgotten GPU workspace = entire month's budget gone in 4 days

### ❌ Problem 2: No Budget Alerts
**Scenario**: Week 4, Sarah hits 80% of budget

**What should happen** (MISSING):
```
📧 Email Alert: Budget Warning - 80% Spent
   Project: Personal Research
   Spent: $80.00 / $100.00 (80%)
   Remaining: $20.00
   Days left in month: 8

   Current instances:
   - rnaseq-analysis: Running ($2.40/day)

   Recommendation: You have $20 remaining for 8 days.
   Consider hibernating workspaces when not in use.
```

**Current workaround**: Sarah checks `cws cost summary` daily
**Impact**: Constant cognitive load, anxiety about overspending

### ❌ Problem 3: No Spending Forecasts
**Scenario**: Mid-month, Sarah wants to know if she can launch another instance

**What should happen** (MISSING):
```bash
cws budget forecast

# Output:
# 📊 Budget Forecast - Personal Research
#
# Current spend: $45.00 (Day 15 of 30)
# Projected end-of-month: $90.00
# Budget: $100.00
# Remaining buffer: $10.00 ✅
#
# Active instances:
# - rnaseq-analysis (hibernated): ~$1.20/day with current usage pattern
#
# Can I launch another instance?
# ✅ t3.medium ($0.80/day): Yes, $14 projected addition = $104 total (slightly over)
# ✅ t3.small ($0.40/day): Yes, $7 projected addition = $97 total ✅
# ❌ r5.xlarge ($2.40/day): No, $36 projected addition = $126 total ⚠️
```

**Current workaround**: Sarah does mental math and Excel calculations
**Impact**: Decision paralysis - hesitant to launch workspaces even when budget allows

### ❌ Problem 4: No Month-End Reporting
**Scenario**: End of month, PI asks "How much did you spend and on what?"

**What should happen** (MISSING):
```bash
cws budget report --month september

# Output (markdown + PDF):
# 📊 CloudWorkstation Monthly Report - September 2024
#
# Budget: $100.00
# Actual Spend: $87.50 ✅
# Savings: $12.50
#
# Workspace Usage:
# ┌────────────────────┬──────────┬──────────┬────────────┬──────────┐
# │ Workspace           │ Template │ Hours    │ Cost       │ Savings  │
# ├────────────────────┼──────────┼──────────┼────────────┼──────────┤
# │ rnaseq-analysis    │ Bioinfo  │ 72h      │ $87.50     │ $45.30   │
# │ (hibernated: 96h)  │          │          │            │          │
# └────────────────────┴──────────┴──────────┴────────────┴──────────┘
#
# Top Cost Drivers:
# 1. Compute (r5.xlarge): $87.50
# 2. Storage (EFS): $0.00 (no persistent storage used)
#
# Efficiency Metrics:
# - Hibernation rate: 57% (excellent!)
# - Average session: 4.2 hours
# - Cost per research day: $5.83
```

**Current workaround**: Sarah exports AWS billing data to Excel, manually categorizes
**Impact**: 2 hours/month of administrative work, prone to errors

#
# Subject: ⚠️ CloudWorkstation Budget Alert: 80% Used
#
# Hi Sarah,
#
# You've reached 80% of your monthly CloudWorkstation budget.
#
# Current Status:
# - Spent: $80.00 / $100.00
# - Remaining: $20.00
# - Days left: 8
#
# Active Instances:
# - rnaseq-analysis: Currently hibernated
# - Projected remaining cost: $9.60 ✅
#
# You're on track! At current usage, you'll finish the month at ~$90.
#
# Actions:
# - View details: cws budget status
# - Adjust hibernation: cws idle profile edit budget-safe
# - Stop all instances: cws stop --all
#
# Best,
# CloudWorkstation

# Sarah checks status
cws budget status
