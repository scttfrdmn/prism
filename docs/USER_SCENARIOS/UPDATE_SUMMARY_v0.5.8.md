---

### 7. 08_INSTITUTIONAL_RESEARCH_IT_WALKTHROUGH.md
**Changes Made**:
- ✅ Updated version reference: v0.5.5 → v0.5.8

- ✅ Replaced "instance_limits" → "workspace_limits"
- ✅ Replaced "max_simultaneous_instances" → "max_simultaneous_workspaces"
- ✅ Replaced "max_gpu_instances" → "max_gpu_workspaces"
- ✅ Replaced "instances-launched" metric → "workspaces-launched"

**Sections Affected**:
- Cost management policies (budget action thresholds)
- Workspace limits configuration
- Institutional monitoring metrics
- Usage tracking and reporting

**Notes**:
- Research IT admin persona uses advanced administrative commands
- Wizard not relevant for this administrative/infrastructure management role
- Already had "workspaces" in most places (line 530), only policy configs needed updates

---

## Quick Start Wizard Integration Assessment

Based on persona analysis, the Quick Start wizard (`prism init`) is most appropriate for:

### ✅ **Should Include Wizard Examples**:
1. **University Class** (03) - Students (beginners) benefit from guided setup
2. **Conference Workshop** (04) - Participants (varied skills) need quick onboarding

### ⚠️ **Optional/Contextual**:
3. **Lab Environment** (02) - New grad students (like Maria) could use wizard
   - Added note that advanced users (PI, postdocs) use direct commands

### ❌ **Not Appropriate**:
4. **Cross-Institutional** (05) - Experienced researchers use advanced features
5. **NIH CUI Compliance** (06) - Command-line proficiency assumed for compliance
6. **NIH HIPAA Compliance** (07) - Highly regulated, requires expert knowledge
7. **Institutional IT** (08) - Administrative role, uses advanced commands

---

## Terminology Strategy

### **Consistent Usage**:
- **"workspace"** = User-facing Prism research environment
- **"EC2 instance"** = Underlying AWS infrastructure (when distinction needed)
- **"workspaces"** = Plural of workspace (user context)
- **"instances"** = Only when explicitly referring to AWS EC2 instances

### **Context Preservation**:
- Maintained "instances" in phrases like:
  - "max-instances 2" (quota/limit contexts)
  - "EC2 instances" (AWS infrastructure contexts)
  - "instance types" (AWS terminology)
  
### **Added Clarity**:
- Added terminology note in Lab Environment document explaining distinction
- This note serves as reference for all documents

## Backup Files Created

All original files backed up with `.bak` extension before modifications.

---

## Quality Assurance

### Verification Performed:
- ✅ Version numbers updated where applicable (v0.5.5 → v0.5.8)
- ✅ Terminology consistent across all documents
- ✅ No unintended "EC2 instance" → "workspace" replacements
- ✅ Backup files created for all modifications
- ✅ Consistency with 01_SOLO_RESEARCHER_WALKTHROUGH.md (reference document)

### Testing Recommendations:
1. Review each document for readability and context-appropriate terminology
2. Verify code examples still make sense with new terminology
3. Check that compliance documents maintain technical accuracy
4. Ensure wizard examples (where added) align with persona skill levels

---

## Next Steps

1. **Review**: Human review of updated documents for accuracy
2. **Wizard Examples**: Consider adding detailed wizard transcripts to:
   - 03_UNIVERSITY_CLASS_WALKTHROUGH.md (Maria's first-time student setup)
   - 04_CONFERENCE_WORKSHOP_WALKTHROUGH.md (participant quick start)
3. **Testing**: Validate command examples still work with new terminology
4. **Documentation**: Update any cross-references in other docs that point to these scenarios

### 8. 07_NIH_RESEARCHER_PHI_HIPAA_COMPLIANCE.md
**Changes Made**:
- ✅ No version number update needed (compliance-focused document, no version reference)
- ✅ Already used "workspace" terminology throughout
- ✅ No "launch instance" or similar phrases found

**Sections Affected**:
- None - document already aligned with v0.5.8 terminology

**Notes**:
- HIPAA compliance persona is experienced researcher using advanced features
- Document correctly uses "workspace" in user-facing contexts
- "EC2 instance" preserved for AWS infrastructure references
- No changes required - document was already current

---

**Status**: ✅ All 8 persona documents successfully updated for v0.5.8
