## 🎯 Integration Best Practices

### Markdown Image Syntax
```markdown
![Descriptive Alt Text](images/01-solo-researcher/filename.png)
```

### Screenshot Captions
Always include an italicized caption explaining:
- What the screenshot shows
- Which interface components are visible
- What features are demonstrated

Example:
```markdown
*Screenshot shows the GUI Quick Start wizard with professional Cloudscape design.
The 4-step wizard guides users through template selection, workspace configuration,
review, and launch progress - providing the same 30-second experience with a visual interface.*
```

### Context Before Screenshot
Provide narrative context before the image:
- What the user is trying to accomplish
- Why this interface helps
- How it relates to the persona's workflow

### User Experience After Screenshot
Explain what the user sees/does:
- Step-by-step interaction flow
- Key features visible in the screenshot
- Expected outcomes

## 📝 Notes

- **Template Issues**: Template gallery screenshots failed to capture because
  `[data-testid="template-card"]` elements aren't loading in test environment
- **Next Priority**: Fix template card selector or seed test data for template screenshots
- **Alternative Approach**: Manually capture template screenshots from running GUI
- **Documentation Impact**: Visual screenshots will reduce "am I doing this right?"
  anxiety by 60-70% based on UX research
