# Scenario 4: Conference Workshop

## Persona: Dr. Alex Rivera - Workshop Instructor

**Background**:
- Assistant Professor, Machine Learning researcher
- Accepted to teach 3-hour workshop at NeurIPS 2025
- Workshop: "Hands-on Deep Learning with PyTorch"
- Expected attendance: 40-60 participants (international)
- Budget: $200 from conference organizers (one-time allocation)
- **Critical constraint**: Must work perfectly on first try - no second chances

**Pain Points**:
- Participants arrive with varying laptop configurations (Windows/Mac/Linux)
- Limited time for troubleshooting (workshop starts in 90 minutes)
- Need identical environments for all participants to follow along
- Budget must cover entire workshop duration + buffer
- International participants in multiple timezones for pre-workshop prep
- **Must auto-terminate** - can't rely on participants to clean up afterwards

**Workshop Structure**:
- **Week before**: Send invitation links to registered participants
- **Day before**: Early access for testing (24-hour window)
- **Workshop day**: 3-hour hands-on session
- **Auto-cleanup**: Terminate all instances 3 hours after workshop ends

---

## Current State (v0.5.5): What Works Today

### ‚úÖ Pre-Workshop Setup (1 Week Before)

```bash
# Alex sets up workshop environment
cws profile create neurips-workshop --aws-profile alex-research --region us-west-2

# Create template-restricted project for workshop
cws project create neurips-dl-workshop \
  --budget 200 \
  --description "NeurIPS 2025: Deep Learning Workshop" \
  --alert-threshold 80

# Generate batch invitations for 60 participants
cat > workshop_participants.csv << EOF
Name,Type,ValidDays,CanInvite,Transferable,DeviceBound,MaxDevices
Participant_01,read_only,7,no,no,yes,2
Participant_02,read_only,7,no,no,yes,2
Participant_03,read_only,7,no,no,yes,2
[... 57 more participants ...]
EOF

# Create invitations with basic policy restrictions
cws profiles invitations batch-create \
  --csv-file workshop_participants.csv \
  --output-file invitation_codes.csv \
  --include-encoded
```

**Current capabilities**:
- ‚úÖ Batch invitation generation (60 participants in seconds)
- ‚úÖ Time-boxed access (7-day expiration)
- ‚úÖ **Access extension**: Can extend for additional day(s) so participants can continue working
- ‚úÖ Device binding (prevents casual sharing)
- ‚úÖ Budget allocation ($200 total)
- ‚úÖ Basic policy restrictions (template whitelist)

üí° **Workshop Extension Example**: After 3-hour workshop ends, Alex can extend access for 24 hours:
```bash
cws profiles invitations extend neurips-workshop --add-days 1
# All 60 participants get automatic 24-hour extension
# Great for: Homework completion, extended tutorials, follow-up work
```

### ‚úÖ Day Before Workshop (Early Access Testing)

```bash
# Participants receive email with invitation link
# They accept invitation and test their environment

# Participant workflow:
cws profiles invitations accept <INVITATION-CODE> neurips-workshop
cws launch pytorch-ml workshop-test --size S

# Alex monitors early access
cws project instances neurips-dl-workshop
# Output:
# ‚úÖ 12 participants tested successfully
# ‚ö†Ô∏è  3 participants having issues (Alex contacts them)
# üí∞ Current spend: $4.20 (within budget)
```

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Pain Points: What Doesn't Work

### ‚ùå Problem 1: No Automatic Instance Termination

**Scenario**: Workshop ends at 3:00 PM, instances should terminate at 6:00 PM

**What should happen** (MISSING):
```bash
# Alex launches instances with auto-terminate timer
cws launch pytorch-ml workshop-instance --hours 6

# CloudWorkstation output:
# ‚úÖ Instance launching: workshop-instance
# ‚è∞ Auto-terminate scheduled: 6 hours from now (6:00 PM)
# üìä Cost for 6 hours: $3.20
# üîî Warning will be sent 30 minutes before termination
```

**Current workaround**: Alex must manually stop 60 instances or rely on participants
**Risk**: If forgotten, $200 budget exhausted in 3 days

### ‚ùå Problem 2: No Template Whitelisting at Invitation Level

**Scenario**: Participants should ONLY be able to launch PyTorch ML template

**What should happen** (MISSING):
```bash
# Create invitations with template restrictions
cws profiles invitations batch-create \
  --csv-file participants.csv \
  --template-whitelist "PyTorch Machine Learning" \
  --max-instance-type "t3.medium" \
  --output-file invitations.csv

# When participant tries wrong template:
participant$ cws launch gpu-ml-workstation expensive-instance
# ‚ùå Error: Template 'gpu-ml-workstation' not allowed by your invitation policy
#    Allowed templates: ["PyTorch Machine Learning"]
#
#    This is a workshop environment with restricted templates.
#    Please use: cws launch "PyTorch Machine Learning" my-instance
```

**Current workaround**: Trust participants + budget alerts
**Risk**: Single participant launches GPU instance ‚Üí $600/day ‚Üí budget blown in 8 hours

### ‚ùå Problem 3: No Bulk Launch for Pre-Provisioning

**Scenario**: Workshop starts at 9:00 AM, Alex wants all environments ready at 8:45 AM

**What should happen** (MISSING):
```bash
# Night before workshop: Pre-provision all instances
cws project bulk-launch neurips-dl-workshop \
  --template "PyTorch Machine Learning" \
  --count 60 \
  --name-pattern "workshop-{01-60}" \
  --start-time "2025-12-08T08:45:00" \
  --terminate-hours 6

# Output:
# üöÄ Scheduling 60 instance launches for Dec 8, 8:45 AM
# üìä Estimated cost: $192.00 (within $200 budget ‚úÖ)
# ‚è∞ All instances will auto-terminate at 2:45 PM (3-hour workshop)
#
# üí° Effective Cost Analysis:
#    24/7 assumption: $2.40/hour √ó 60 instances √ó 24 hours = $3,456
#    Actual workshop cost: $2.40/hour √ó 60 instances √ó 3 hours = $432
#    Your cost with auto-terminate: $192 (early terminations banked immediately)
#    Savings: $240 banked in real-time as participants finish early!
#
# Instance name assignments:
# - Participant_01 ‚Üí workshop-01
# - Participant_02 ‚Üí workshop-02
# ...

# 8:45 AM on workshop day - all instances auto-launch
# 9:00 AM - participants arrive, instances are ready
```

> **üí° GUI Note**: Workshop scheduling available in GUI Projects tab with calendar view - *coming soon in v0.6.0*

**Current workaround**: Participants launch on-demand (slow, error-prone)
**Impact**: First 30 minutes wasted on environment setup

### ‚ùå Problem 4: No Real-Time Workshop Dashboard

**Scenario**: During workshop, Alex needs to see participant progress at a glance

**What should happen** (MISSING):
```bash
cws workshop dashboard neurips-dl-workshop

# Terminal dashboard (live updates):
# ‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îê

```

> **üí° GUI Note**: Live workshop dashboard available in GUI with real-time participant status - *coming soon in v0.6.0*

**Current workaround**: Manual `cws list` + `cws project instances` polling
**Impact**: Can't proactively help struggling participants

### ‚ùå Problem 5: No Post-Workshop Data Preservation

**Scenario**: Participants want to keep their workshop code after instances terminate

**What should happen** (MISSING):
```bash
# 30 minutes before auto-terminate, participants receive email:
#
# Subject: ‚è∞ Workshop Instance Terminating in 30 Minutes
#
# Your workshop instance will terminate at 6:00 PM (in 30 minutes).
#
# To preserve your work:
#
# 1. Download your notebook:
#    cws download workshop-instance ~/workshop-code.zip
#
# 2. Or snapshot your instance:
#    cws snapshot create workshop-instance my-workshop-work
#    (This will create a personal AMI - $2.50/month storage)
#
# After termination, you can recreate your environment:
#    cws launch-from-snapshot my-workshop-work restored-env

# Bulk download (instructor):
cws workshop export-all neurips-dl-workshop \
  --output-dir ./participant-work/ \
  --format zip

# Creates:
# ./participant-work/
#   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ workshop-01.zip (Participant_01's notebooks)
#   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ workshop-02.zip (Participant_02's notebooks)
#   ...
```

**Current workaround**: Participants manually SCP files (most don't)
**Impact**: Lost learning artifacts, can't reproduce workshop results

# üìß Reminder emails:
#    - Send reminder to 43 accepted-not-tested? [Y/n]: y
#    - Send urgent reminder to 2 not-accepted? [Y/n]: y
```

### Workshop Day: Smooth Execution

**8:45 AM - Pre-provisioning (optional)**:
```bash
# Option A: Let participants launch on-demand (default)
# - Slower but gives participants control
# - Launch time: ~2 minutes per instance

# Option B: Pre-provision all instances (advanced)
cws workshop bulk-provision neurips-dl-workshop \
  --template "PyTorch Machine Learning" \
  --size S \

# Participants launch (if not pre-provisioned):
participant$ cws launch "PyTorch Machine Learning" workshop-instance
# ‚úÖ Instance ready in 90 seconds!
# üìì Jupyter Lab: http://54.123.45.67:8888 (token: abc123)
# ‚è∞ Instance will auto-terminate at 3:00 PM (6 hours)
# üí° To save your work: cws download workshop-instance ~/my-work.zip
```

**10:30 AM - Participant needs help**:
```bash
# Dashboard shows participant_27 with high error rate
# Alex remotely debugs (with participant permission):
alex$ cws workshop debug neurips-dl-workshop workshop-27

# Options:
# 1. View Jupyter logs
# 2. View terminal output
# 3. SSH access (requires participant approval)
# 4. Reset notebook kernel
# 5. Restart instance

# Alex selects option 1, identifies issue, helps participant
```

**2:30 PM - 30 minutes before auto-terminate**:
```bash
# All participants automatically receive email + terminal notification:
#
# ‚è∞ Your workshop instance will terminate in 30 minutes!
#
# Save your work now:
#   cws download workshop-instance ~/neurips-workshop.zip
#
# Or create a snapshot to continue later:
#   cws snapshot create workshop-instance my-dl-work
#   (Costs $2.50/month, can recreate anytime)

# Participants who want to continue (personal budget):
participant$ cws snapshot create workshop-instance my-workshop
# ‚úÖ Snapshot created: my-workshop
# üí∞ Storage cost: $2.50/month (personal account)
#
# To recreate:
#   cws launch-from-snapshot my-workshop continued-work
```

**3:00 PM - Workshop ends, auto-terminate begins**:
```bash
# CloudWorkstation automatically:
# 1. Sends final warning (5 minutes before)
# 2. Terminates all instances at 3:00 PM sharp
# 3. Generates cost report
# 4. Archives workshop data (optional)

# Alex receives final report:
cws workshop report neurips-dl-workshop --export-pdf

# Output:

## Key Differences from University Class Scenario

| Aspect | Workshop (3 hours) | Class (15 weeks) |
|--------|-------------------|------------------|
| **Duration** | Single 3-hour session | 15-week semester |
| **Preparation** | 1 week (must be perfect) | 2-4 weeks (iterate) |
| **Budget** | One-time $200 | Semester $1,200 with rollover |
| **Access** | 6-hour window + cleanup | Ongoing with extensions |
| **Cleanup** | Immediate auto-terminate | Gradual semester-end |
| **Support** | On-site only (3 hours) | Office hours + TAs |
| **Participants** | 40-60 attendees | 50 students |
| **TA Structure** | None or single assistant | Head TA + multiple TAs |
| **Failure Cost** | Workshop disaster | Grade assignment issues |

---

## Reusable Infrastructure from Class Scenario

‚úÖ **Already applicable**:
- Batch invitation system
- Device binding security
- Budget allocation and tracking
- Template restrictions via policy

üîß **Needs adaptation**:
- Time limits: 6 hours vs 15 weeks
- Budget model: One-time vs recurring
- Auto-cleanup: Immediate vs gradual
- Support structure: Self-service vs TA hierarchy

---

## Next Steps

1. **Validate with Real Workshop Instructors**: Interview 2-3 conference workshop presenters
2. **Prototype Auto-Terminate**: Implement basic time-limited launches
3. **Design Workshop Dashboard**: Mock up live monitoring interface
4. **Implementation Plan**: Break down into 2-week sprints

**Estimated Timeline**: Workshop Safety Net (Phase 1) ‚Üí 3 weeks of development

---

## Comparison: Workshop vs Class

**Similarities**:
- Batch user onboarding
- Template standardization
- Budget constraints
- Time-boxed access

**Critical Differences**:
```
Workshop = "High-stakes, single-shot performance"
Class = "Ongoing management with iteration opportunities"

Workshop auto-terminate = "6 hours hard deadline"
Class semester end = "Graceful 2-week wind-down"

Workshop budget = "$200 total, must not exceed"
Class budget = "$1,200 with weekly monitoring and adjustments"
```

**When to use each**:
- **Workshop project**: Single-day events, tutorials, short courses
- **Class project**: Semester-long courses, research bootcamps, training programs
