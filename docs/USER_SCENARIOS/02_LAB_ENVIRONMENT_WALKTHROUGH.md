## Current State (v0.5.5): What Works Today

### ‚úÖ Lab Setup (Phase 4 Complete)

#### Step 1: PI Creates Organization
```bash
# Dr. Smith creates lab organization
prism project create "Smith Lab" \
  --description "Computational Biology Research Group" \
  --owner patricia.smith@university.edu

# Output:
# ‚úÖ Project created: Smith Lab (proj-abc123)
```

#### Step 2: Create Grant Projects
```bash
# NIH Grant project
prism project create "NIH-R01-2023" \
  --parent "Smith Lab" \
  --budget 2000 \
  --budget-period monthly \
  --description "RNA-seq and transcriptomics research"

# NSF Grant project
prism project create "NSF-2024-ML" \
  --parent "Smith Lab" \
  --budget 1500 \
  --budget-period monthly \
  --description "Machine learning for protein structure prediction"

# Discretionary
prism project create "Discretionary" \
  --parent "Smith Lab" \
  --budget 1000 \
  --budget-period monthly \
  --description "PI discretionary funds"
```

#### Step 3: Add Lab Members with Roles
```bash
# Add senior staff with Admin role
prism project member add "NIH-R01-2023" \
  --email michael.torres@university.edu \
  --role admin \
  --budget-allocation 800

prism project member add "NSF-2024-ML" \
  --email lisa.park@university.edu \
  --role admin \
  --budget-allocation 800

# Add graduate students with Member role
prism project member add "NIH-R01-2023" \
  --email james.wilson@university.edu \
  --role member \
  --budget-allocation 400

prism project member add "NSF-2024-ML" \
  --email maria.garcia@university.edu \
  --role member \
  --budget-allocation 300
```

#### Step 4: Configure Budget Alerts
```bash
# Alert PI at 75% and 90% of each project
prism project budget alert add "NIH-R01-2023" \
  --threshold 75 \
  --email patricia.smith@university.edu

prism project budget alert add "NIH-R01-2023" \
  --threshold 90 \
  --email patricia.smith@university.edu,michael.torres@university.edu

# Same for other projects...
```

### ‚úÖ Daily Lab Operations (What Works)

#### Scenario: James (Grad Student) Runs RNA-seq Pipeline
```bash
# James launches instance
prism launch bioinformatics-suite rnaseq-sample-42 \
  --project "NIH-R01-2023" \
  --size M

# Prism output:
# ‚úÖ Workspace launching: rnaseq-sample-42
# üìä Cost: $2.40/day (r5.xlarge)
# üí∞ Project budget: $245 / $400 (61% used this month)
# üîó SSH ready in ~90 seconds...

# James works for 4 hours, then stops
prism stop rnaseq-sample-42

# ‚úÖ Workspace stopped - charges cease immediately
# üí∞ Real-time budget update: $9.60 "banked" back to available budget
#    (Would have cost $57.60 for 24 hours, you paid $9.60 for 4 hours)
#    The $48 you DIDN'T spend is now available for other lab members!

# Cost tracking automatically updated
prism project cost show "NIH-R01-2023"

# Output:
# üí∞ Project: NIH-R01-2023 Budget Status
#    Monthly budget: $2,000.00
#    Current spend: $1,245.80 (62%)
#    Available for new launches: $754.20 + $1,890 banked savings
#
#    üí° Effective Cost: $2.10/hour avg (vs $4.80/hour 24/7 assumption)
#       Hibernation/stop savings across all instances: $1,890 this month!
#       This is REAL MONEY you can spend on more compute!
#
#    By member:
#    - michael.torres: $720.50 / $800.00 (90%) - 343 compute hours
#    - james.wilson: $245.30 / $400.00 (61%) - 123 compute hours
#    - Shared resources: $280.00 / $800.00 (35%) - 140 compute hours
#
# üí° Cloud vs Owned Hardware Reality:
#    Owned workstation: $5,000 upfront + depreciation whether used or not
#    Prism: Pay $1,245 for 606 actual compute hours
#    Every hibernation/stop IMMEDIATELY increases available budget!
```

#### Scenario: Lab Manager Monitors Usage
```bash
# Dr. Torres checks overall lab status
prism project list --tree

# Output:
# Smith Lab
# ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ NIH-R01-2023: $1,245 / $2,000 (62%) ‚úÖ
# ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ michael.torres: $720 / $800 (90%) ‚ö†Ô∏è

# ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ lisa.park: $650 / $800 (81%) ‚ö†Ô∏è
# ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ maria.garcia: $130 / $300 (43%) ‚úÖ
# ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Discretionary: $50 / $1,000 (5%) ‚úÖ
#
# Total: $2,275 / $4,500 (51%) ‚úÖ
# Rollover from last month: $225 (from NIH-R01-2023 underspend)
# Next month budget: $4,725
#
# üí° Effective Lab Cost: $2.10/hour (vs $5.50/hour 24/7 assumption)
#    Lab is paying for 1,083 compute hours, not 8,760 hours/month!

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Pain Points: What Doesn't Work

### ‚ùå Problem 1: No Sub-Budget Hierarchy
**Scenario**: Dr. Park wants to allocate her $800 between her own work and grad student Maria

**What should work** (MISSING):
```bash
# Dr. Park creates sub-budgets from her allocation
prism project budget allocate "NSF-2024-ML" \
  --member lisa.park \
  --subdivide \
  --personal 500 \
  --delegate maria.garcia 300

# Result should be:
# NSF-2024-ML: $800 allocated to lisa.park
# ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ lisa.park (personal): $500
# ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ maria.garcia (supervised by lisa.park): $300
```

**Current limitation**: Flat budget allocation only - no delegation
**Workaround**: Manual tracking in spreadsheet, trust system
**Impact**: Dr. Park can't manage her sub-team independently

### ‚ùå Problem 2: No Approval Workflows
**Scenario**: Maria (beginner grad student) tries to launch expensive GPU workspace

**What should happen** (MISSING):
```bash
# Maria attempts GPU launch
prism launch gpu-ml-workstation protein-experiment --project "NSF-2024-ML"

# Prism should prompt:
# ‚ö†Ô∏è  APPROVAL REQUIRED: GPU Workspace Launch
#
#    Requested by: maria.garcia@university.edu
#    Instance: p3.2xlarge ($24.80/day)
#    Project: NSF-2024-ML
#    Your budget: $130 / $300 (43%)
#
#    This workspace exceeds your authority level.
#    Approval request sent to:
#    - Dr. Lisa Park (lisa.park@university.edu) - Project lead
#    - Dr. Michael Torres (michael.torres@university.edu) - Lab manager
#
#    Request ID: req-xyz789
#    Status: Pending approval (will notify via email)
#
#    You can check status with: prism approval status req-xyz789

# Dr. Park receives email:
# Subject: Approval Request: GPU Workspace Launch (Maria Garcia)
#
# Maria Garcia has requested approval to launch:
# - Instance: p3.2xlarge (1 GPU, $24.80/day)
# - Project: NSF-2024-ML
# - Justification: "Need GPU for protein folding simulation homework"
# - Estimated cost: $24.80 (8 hour time limit requested)
#
# Maria's budget: $130 / $300 (43% used)
# Project budget: $980 / $1,500 (65% used)
#
# Approve or deny: prism approval review req-xyz789
```

**Current state**: No approval system - relies on role-based restrictions only
**Workaround**: Maria asks in Slack, someone with admin role launches for her
**Impact**: Bypasses audit trails, confusion about who launched what

### ‚ùå Problem 3: No Time-Boxed Collaborator Access
**Scenario**: Visiting scholar Dr. Kim joins for 3-month collaboration

**What should work** (MISSING):
```bash
# Dr. Smith grants temporary access
prism project member add "NIH-R01-2023" \
  --email dr.kim@external.edu \
  --role member \
  --budget-allocation 200 \
  --start-date 2024-06-01 \
  --end-date 2024-08-31 \
  --auto-revoke \
  --notify-before-expiry 7days

# Result:
# ‚úÖ Temporary member added: dr.kim@external.edu
#    Access: June 1 - August 31, 2024 (90 days)
#    Budget: $200/month
#    Auto-revoke: September 1, 2024 at 00:00 UTC
#    Reminder: August 25, 2024 (7 days before)

# On August 25, both Dr. Kim and Dr. Smith receive email:
# Subject: Collaborator Access Expiring Soon
#
# Dr. Kim's access to project "NIH-R01-2023" expires in 7 days.
#
# Current usage:
# - Instances: 1 active (rnaseq-collaboration)
# - Spend: $180 / $200 (90%)
#
# Actions:
# 1. Extend access: prism project member extend dr.kim@external.edu --days 30
# 2. Let expire: Workspaces will be stopped, data archived on Sep 1
# 3. Convert to permanent: prism project member permanent dr.kim@external.edu

# On September 1 at 00:00 UTC (auto-revoke):
# - Dr. Kim's workspaces automatically stopped
# - SSH keys revoked from all project instances
# - EFS home directory archived to S3
# - Email sent to both parties confirming revocation
```

**Current state**: Manual member management - no expiration dates
**Workaround**: Calendar reminders, manual revocation
**Impact**: Forgotten temp users accumulate, security risk, budget waste

### ‚ùå Problem 4: No Resource Quotas by Role
**Scenario**: Grad students should have workspace limits to prevent mistakes

**What should work** (MISSING):
```bash
# PI configures role-based quotas
prism project policy create "NIH-R01-2023" \
  --role member \
  --max-instances 2 \
  --max-instance-cost 5.00/day \
  --allowed-instance-types "t3.*,r5.large,r5.xlarge" \
  --blocked-instance-types "p3.*,p4.*"  # No GPUs

# Maria tries to launch 3rd instance
prism launch bioinformatics-suite experiment-3 --project "NIH-R01-2023"

# Prism output:
# ‚ùå Launch failed: Quota exceeded
#
#    Your quota (Member role):
#    - Instances: 2 / 2 (100%)
#    - Current instances:
#      1. rnaseq-analysis (running)
#      2. protein-prep (stopped)
#
#    To launch another instance:
#    1. Stop or delete an existing instance
#    2. Request quota increase from lab manager
#
#    Contact: michael.torres@university.edu

# Maria tries GPU workspace
prism launch gpu-ml-workstation experiment-gpu --project "NIH-R01-2023"

# Prism output:
# ‚ùå Launch failed: Workspace type not allowed
#
#    p3.2xlarge is not permitted for Member role.
#    Allowed workspace types: t3.*, r5.large, r5.xlarge
#
#    For GPU access, request approval from:
#    - Dr. Michael Torres (Lab Manager)
#    - Dr. Patricia Smith (PI)
```

**Current state**: Basic role permissions only (owner/admin/member/viewer)
**Workaround**: Trust-based system, post-incident corrections
**Impact**: Accidental expensive launches, budget surprises

### ‚ùå Problem 5: No Grant Period Management
**Scenario**: NIH grant ends June 30 - need to freeze project and generate final report

**What should work** (MISSING):
```bash
# Dr. Smith configures grant end date
prism project configure "NIH-R01-2023" \
  --end-date 2024-06-30 \
  --freeze-after-end \
  --final-report-email patricia.smith@university.edu

# June 30, 2024 at 23:59 (automatic actions):
# 1. All running workspaces stopped
# 2. No new launches allowed
# 3. Project marked as "Archived"
# 4. Final cost report generated

# Email sent to Dr. Smith:
# Subject: Project Archived: NIH-R01-2023 Final Report
#
# The NIH-R01-2023 project has been automatically archived as of June 30, 2024.
#
# Final Statistics:
# - Total spend (12 months): $23,450 / $24,000 budget (97.7%)
# - Unused budget: $550
# - Total compute hours: 14,520
# - Hibernation savings: $4,230 (15%)
#
# Active resources at archive time:
# - Instances: 4 (all stopped automatically)
# - EFS volumes: 2 (maintained for 90-day archive period)
#
# Data Archive:
# - EFS snapshots: s3://smith-lab-archives/NIH-R01-2023/
# - Workspace configs: s3://smith-lab-archives/NIH-R01-2023/instances.json
# - Cost reports: s3://smith-lab-archives/NIH-R01-2023/reports/
#
# Next steps:
# 1. Review final report (attached PDF)
# 2. Data will be archived to S3 and EFS volumes deleted after 90 days
# 3. To restore project: prism project restore NIH-R01-2023

# Generate grant office report
prism project report "NIH-R01-2023" \
  --start 2023-07-01 \
  --end 2024-06-30 \
  --format pdf \
  --template nih-final-report \
  --output ~/Desktop/NIH-R01-2023-final.pdf

# Report includes:
# - Monthly spend breakdown
# - Cost by resource type (compute, storage, network)
# - Per-member usage and efficiency
# - Hibernation/cost optimization summary
# - Workspace type distribution
# - Peak usage periods
# - Compliance: All expenses within approved budget
```

**Current state**: Manual project closure, no automated archiving
**Workaround**: PI tracks grant dates in calendar, manually stops instances
**Impact**: Forgotten projects continue spending, archiving is ad-hoc
