# Getting Started with CloudWorkstation

## Quick Start (5 minutes)

CloudWorkstation launches pre-configured research environments in seconds. No complex setup required.

### 1. Install CloudWorkstation
```bash
# Install via Homebrew (macOS/Linux)
brew tap scttfrdmn/cloudworkstation
brew install cloudworkstation

# Or download directly
curl -L https://github.com/scttfrdmn/cloudworkstation/releases/latest/download/cws-macos-arm64 -o cws
chmod +x cws
```

### 2. Configure AWS Credentials
CloudWorkstation uses your existing AWS credentials. If you don't have them set up:

```bash
# Install AWS CLI if needed
brew install awscli

# Configure your credentials
aws configure
```

**Required AWS Permissions**: CloudWorkstation needs EC2, EFS, and Systems Manager access. See [AWS Setup Guide](docs/DEMO_TESTER_SETUP.md) for detailed IAM policies.

### 3. Start CloudWorkstation
```bash
# Start the background service
cws daemon start

# Launch interactive interface
cws tui
```

### 4. Launch Your First Environment
```bash
# See available templates
cws templates

# Launch a Python ML environment
cws launch python-ml my-first-project

# Get connection info
cws connect my-first-project
```

That's it! Your research environment is ready.

## Choose Your Interface

CloudWorkstation offers three ways to interact:

### üñ•Ô∏è **GUI (Desktop App)**
Perfect for visual management and one-click operations.
```bash
cws-gui
```

### üì± **TUI (Terminal Interface)**  
Keyboard-driven interface for remote work and SSH sessions.
```bash
cws tui
```

### üíª **CLI (Command Line)**
Scriptable interface for automation and power users.
```bash
cws launch python-ml my-project --size L
```

## Essential Commands

### Template Management
```bash
cws templates                    # List available environments
cws templates info python-ml    # Get template details
cws launch python-ml my-project # Launch environment
```

### Instance Management
```bash
cws list                        # Show running instances
cws connect my-project          # Get connection info
cws stop my-project             # Stop when not in use
cws start my-project            # Resume later
cws delete my-project           # Remove completely
```

### Cost Optimization
```bash
cws hibernate my-project        # Preserve RAM, reduce costs
cws resume my-project           # Resume hibernated instance
cws idle enable                 # Auto-hibernate idle instances
```

## Common Research Workflows

### Data Science Project
```bash
# Launch Jupyter environment
cws launch python-ml data-analysis --size L

# Create shared storage
cws volume create shared-datasets

# Connect and start working
cws connect data-analysis
# Opens: ssh user@ip-address -L 8888:localhost:8888
# Jupyter: http://localhost:8888
```

### R Statistical Analysis
```bash
# Launch R + RStudio environment
cws launch r-research stats-project

# Get RStudio connection
cws connect stats-project
# Opens: http://ip-address:8787 (RStudio Server)
```

### Custom Environment
```bash
# Start with base template
cws launch basic-ubuntu my-custom

# Customize your setup
cws connect my-custom
# Install packages, configure tools

# Save for reuse
cws save my-custom custom-template
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Daemon not running"
```bash
# Check daemon status
cws daemon status

# Restart if needed
cws daemon stop
cws daemon start
```

### "AWS credentials not found"
```bash
# Verify AWS configuration
aws sts get-caller-identity

# Reconfigure if needed
aws configure
```

### "Permission denied" errors
Make sure your AWS user has the required permissions. See our [AWS Setup Guide](docs/DEMO_TESTER_SETUP.md) for complete IAM policies.

### Instance launch fails
```bash
# Check AWS region and availability
aws ec2 describe-availability-zones

# Try different region
cws launch python-ml my-project --region us-east-1
```

## Advanced Features

### Template Stacking
```bash
# Build on existing templates
cws apply gpu-drivers my-project    # Add GPU support
cws apply docker-tools my-project   # Add Docker
```

### Project Management
```bash
# Create research project
cws project create brain-study --budget 500

# Launch in project context
cws launch neuroimaging analysis --project brain-study
```

### Custom AMIs
```bash
# Build optimized AMI from template
cws ami build python-ml --region us-west-2

# Save running instance as template
cws ami save my-project custom-env
```

**üéØ Key Principle**: CloudWorkstation defaults to success. Most commands work without options, with smart defaults for research computing.
