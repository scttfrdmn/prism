## ✅ **COMPLETED FEATURES**

### **🔧 CLI Command Structure Restructure**
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE** (September 29, 2025)

**Major Changes**:
- **Renamed**: `cws research-user` → `cws user` (cleaner, more intuitive)
- **New Hierarchy**: Added `cws admin` parent command for system administration
- **Organized Commands**: All admin operations now under unified `cws admin` structure

**Command Mapping**:
```bash
# User Management (Researchers)
cws user create <username>          # Create new user
cws user list                       # List all users
cws user delete <username>          # Delete user
cws user ssh-key generate <username> # Generate SSH keys
cws user provision <username> <instance> # Provision user on instance
cws user status <username>          # Show user status

# System Administration
cws admin config <action>           # Configure CloudWorkstation
cws admin daemon <action>           # Manage daemon
cws admin security                  # Security management
cws admin policy <action>           # Policy management
cws admin profiles <action>         # Profile management
cws admin uninstall                 # System uninstallation
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ **Intuitive Discovery**: "Manage users" → `cws user`
- ✅ **Professional Organization**: Clear separation between user and admin operations
- ✅ **Reduced Clutter**: Root command list much cleaner
- ✅ **Industry Standards**: Follows enterprise CLI patterns

**Files Modified**:
- `internal/cli/admin_commands.go` (NEW - 160+ lines)
- `internal/cli/user_commands.go` (RENAMED from research_user_commands.go)
- `internal/cli/root_command.go` (UPDATED)
- `pkg/api/mock/mock_client.go` (FIXED missing policy methods)
