# Technical Debt and Enhancement Backlog

**Last Updated**: October 17, 2025
**Status**: Active tracking of deferred implementations

This document tracks features that were intentionally deferred during development, marked as design decisions rather than immediate TODO items. These represent real work that should be scheduled for future releases.

## ‚úÖ Completed Items (October 17, 2025)

### ‚úÖ 0. SSH Readiness Progress Reporting - COMPLETED
**Location**: `pkg/aws/manager.go:572-589`
**Completed**: October 17, 2025
**Implementation**:
- ‚úÖ Status message feedback with emoji indicators (‚è≥, ‚Üí, ‚úì, ‚ö†Ô∏è, ‚úÖ)
- ‚úÖ `waitForInstanceReadyWithProgress()` integrated into launch flow with progress callback
- ‚úÖ Real-time feedback for instance_ready and ssh_ready stages
- ‚úÖ Graceful error handling with user-friendly messages
**Remaining Work for Full Implementation** (moved to Future Enhancements):
- Thread ProgressReporter through launch orchestration flow for GUI/TUI
- Stream progress updates from daemon to CLI via WebSocket or SSE
- Update TUI to show launch progress with real-time updates
- Update GUI to show launch progress with real-time updates

### ‚úÖ 1. IAM Instance Profile Validation - COMPLETED (Enhanced)
**Location**: `pkg/aws/manager.go:1663-1794`
**Completed**: October 17, 2025
**Implementation**:
- ‚úÖ IAM client added to Manager struct (line 44)
- ‚úÖ IAM client initialized in NewManager (lines 104, 122)
- ‚úÖ Real `GetInstanceProfile()` API call implemented
- ‚úÖ **Auto-creation of CloudWorkstation-Instance-Profile** if it doesn't exist:
  - Creates IAM role with EC2 trust relationship
  - Attaches AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore for SSM access
  - Creates inline policy for autonomous idle detection (EC2 self-management)
  - Tags resources as ManagedBy: CloudWorkstation
- ‚úÖ Graceful fallback when user lacks IAM permissions (logs warning, continues without IAM)
- ‚úÖ Zero-configuration SSM access for users with IAM permissions
**Bonus Deliverables**:
- üìÑ Complete IAM permissions documentation (docs/AWS_IAM_PERMISSIONS.md)
- üìÑ Ready-to-apply IAM policy JSON (docs/cloudworkstation-iam-policy.json)
- üîß Interactive IAM setup script (scripts/setup-iam-permissions.sh)
**Note**: IAM profile auto-creation provides zero-configuration SSM and autonomous features

## High Priority Items

### 2. AWS Quota Management and Intelligent Availability Handling
**Location**: `pkg/aws/manager.go` (new quota monitoring module needed)
**Current Behavior**: No quota awareness, generic launch failures, no AZ failover
**Impact**: Users surprised by quota limits, confusing errors, failed launches in unavailable AZs
**Problem Statement**:
Researchers often don't understand AWS service quotas (vCPU limits, instance type limits per region/AZ). When launches fail, error messages are cryptic. CloudWorkStation should be intelligent about AWS capacity and gracefully handle failures.

**Implementation Needed**:

1. **Quota Awareness** (`pkg/aws/quota_manager.go`):
   - Query AWS Service Quotas API for current limits
   - Track usage against quotas (vCPUs, instances per type, storage)
   - Pre-launch validation: "You have 12/20 vCPUs used, this t3.xlarge (4 vCPU) will use 16/20"
   - Proactive warnings: "Warning: You're at 90% of your vCPU quota in us-west-2"
   - CLI command: `cws admin quota show --region us-west-2`

2. **Quota Increase Assistance** (`pkg/aws/quota_requests.go`):
   - Detect quota-related launch failures
   - Explain what quota was hit and why
   - Provide pre-filled quota increase request URL
   - CLI command: `cws admin quota request --instance-type p3.2xlarge --reason "ML research workload"`
   - Guide users through AWS Support Center quota request process

3. **Intelligent AZ Failover** (`pkg/aws/availability_manager.go`):
   - Detect `InsufficientInstanceCapacity` errors
   - Automatically retry in different AZ within same region
   - User-friendly message: "Instance type unavailable in us-west-2a, trying us-west-2b..."
   - Track AZ health per instance type (recent success rates)
   - Prefer AZs with recent successful launches

4. **AWS Health Dashboard Integration** (`pkg/aws/health_monitor.go`):
   - Monitor AWS Health API for service events
   - Detect regional outages, degraded performance, scheduled maintenance
   - Proactive notifications: "‚ö†Ô∏è AWS reports degraded EC2 performance in us-east-1"
   - Block launches to affected regions with clear explanations
   - Auto-suggest alternative regions with healthy status
   - CLI command: `cws admin aws-health --all-regions`

5. **Capacity Planning** (`pkg/aws/capacity_planner.go`):
   - Analyze historical launch patterns
   - Recommend regions/AZs with best availability for instance types
   - Warn about high-demand instance types (GPU, large memory)
   - Suggest spot instances when on-demand capacity is constrained

**User Experience Examples**:

```bash
# Pre-launch quota check
$ cws launch gpu-ml-workstation my-training --size XL
‚ö†Ô∏è  Quota Check Failed
    Instance type: p3.8xlarge (32 vCPUs, 4 GPUs)
    Current usage: 24/32 vCPUs in us-west-2
    After launch: 56/32 vCPUs ‚ùå (24 over limit)

    You need to request a vCPU quota increase:
    1. Visit: https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/home/services/ec2/quotas/L-1216C47A
    2. Request new limit: 64 vCPUs (allows 2 simultaneous p3.8xlarge)
    3. Typical approval time: 24-48 hours

    Alternative: Launch p3.2xlarge instead? (8 vCPUs, 1 GPU) [Y/n]

# Intelligent AZ failover
$ cws launch bioinformatics-suite genome-analysis
‚úÖ Launching r5.4xlarge in us-west-2a...
‚ö†Ô∏è  InsufficientInstanceCapacity in us-west-2a
üîÑ Retrying in us-west-2b...
‚úÖ Successfully launched in us-west-2b!
üîó SSH ready in ~90 seconds...

# AWS Health monitoring
$ cws launch python-ml earthquake-prediction --region us-east-1
‚ö†Ô∏è  AWS Health Alert: Degraded EC2 Performance in us-east-1
    Event: API_ISSUE (started 15 minutes ago)
    Impact: Elevated launch failures and delayed instance starts
    Status: AWS engineers investigating

    Recommendation: Use us-west-2 (healthy) or wait ~30 minutes
    Launch anyway? [y/N]

# Quota status command
$ cws admin quota show
üìä AWS Service Quotas - us-west-2

vCPU Limits:
  Standard (A, C, D, H, I, M, R, T, Z): 24/32 (75% used) ‚ö†Ô∏è
  GPU (P, G, Inf, DL, Trn):             0/8 (0% used) ‚úÖ

Instance Type Limits:
  p3.2xlarge: 0/2 available ‚úÖ
  r5.xlarge:  3/5 available ‚ö†Ô∏è (approaching limit)
  t3.medium:  8/20 available ‚úÖ

Storage:
  EBS General Purpose (gp3): 3.2TB / 50TB ‚úÖ

Recommendations:
  ‚ö†Ô∏è  Consider requesting vCPU increase for compute-intensive work
  ‚úÖ GPU quota sufficient for current workload
```
