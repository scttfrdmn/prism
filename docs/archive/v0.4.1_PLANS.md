## Overview

The v0.4.1 release will focus on improved distribution and accessibility with:

1. Adding a Graphical User Interface (GUI)
2. Expanding distribution channels beyond GitHub releases
3. Refreshing documentation with a consistent, user-friendly style
4. Improving platform support with multi-architecture builds

## Key Features and Changes

### GUI Implementation

The new GUI will be built using the Fyne toolkit as designed in the GUI architecture document. This will provide:

- System tray/menubar integration
- Dashboard for instance monitoring
- Visual template selection and management
- Drag-and-drop storage management
- Settings management through visual interface
- Dark/light theme support

### Distribution Expansion

To make CloudWorkstation more accessible, we'll add the following distribution channels:

#### Homebrew (macOS and Linux)

Create a Homebrew formula to allow installation via:

```bash
brew install cloudworkstation
```

Requirements:
- Formula in Homebrew tap repository
- Support for both Intel and ARM Macs (universal binary)
- Proper dependency management
- Update mechanism

#### Chocolatey (Windows)

Create a Chocolatey package to allow installation via:

```powershell
choco install cloudworkstation
```

Requirements:
- Package script and metadata
- Windows-specific considerations
- PowerShell integration
- Update mechanism

#### Conda (Cross-platform)

Create a Conda package to allow installation via:

```bash
conda install cloudworkstation -c conda-forge
```

Requirements:
- Package metadata
- Multi-platform support
- Scientific computing ecosystem integration
- Environment isolation

### Documentation Refresh

Implement GitHub Pages for comprehensive documentation:

- Convert markdown docs to a static site
- Organize into user-friendly sections
- Integrate the new logo throughout
- Create quickstart guides for each platform
- Add screenshots of the new GUI
- Include package manager installation instructions

### Multi-Architecture Build System

Enhance the build system to provide:

- x86_64 binaries for all platforms
- ARM64 binaries for macOS and Linux
- Automated testing on multiple architectures
- CI/CD pipeline enhancements for multi-architecture builds
- Consistent packaging across platforms

## Implementation Plan

1. Set up GitHub Pages for documentation using Jekyll or Hugo
2. Create package definitions for Homebrew, Chocolatey, and Conda
3. Update build workflows to generate binaries for multiple architectures
4. Integrate the new logo across all documentation and applications
5. Implement the GUI based on the existing architectural design
6. Write comprehensive documentation for all distribution methods
7. Test installation and usage on all target platforms

## Timeline

- Week 1: Set up GitHub Pages and refresh documentation
- Week 2: Implement package manager definitions and test
- Week 3: Enhance build system for multi-architecture support
- Week 4: GUI implementation and testing
- Week 5: Final integration, testing, and release

## Success Criteria

The v0.4.1 release will be considered successful when:

1. Users can install CloudWorkstation via Homebrew, Chocolatey, or Conda
2. Documentation is available through GitHub Pages with the new style
3. The GUI provides all essential functionality
4. Binaries work correctly on both x86_64 and ARM64 architectures
5. The installation process is documented and tested for all platforms
