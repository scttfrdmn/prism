## Current Documentation

For up-to-date documentation, see the main [docs/](../index.md) directory and the project root documentation files.

## Why Archive?

These documents are preserved because they:
1. Provide historical context for development decisions
2. May contain useful implementation details for future reference
3. Document completed milestones and achievements
4. Could be valuable for understanding the evolution of the project

However, they should not be relied upon for current functionality or procedures.
