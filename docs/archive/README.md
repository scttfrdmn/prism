# Archived Documentation

This directory contains historical documentation that has been archived for reference purposes. These files are no longer actively maintained but are preserved for historical context and continuity.

## Contents

- Release notes for previous versions (prior to v0.4.0)
- Historical implementation plans and roadmaps
- Demo scripts and walkthroughs from previous versions
- Development session summaries

## Usage Guidelines

- These documents should be considered **read-only** and historical in nature
- For current documentation, refer to the main `/docs` directory or the index at `/docs/index.md`
- If information from these archived files needs to be referenced in current documentation, it should be updated and moved to the appropriate location

## Archive Policy

Documents are archived when:
1. They reference features or versions that are no longer current
2. They contain implementation details that have been superseded
3. They describe processes that have been replaced by newer workflows

This archiving strategy helps maintain a clean and relevant documentation set while preserving historical information for context and reference.
