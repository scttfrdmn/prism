## üéâ What Was Accomplished

### Core Architecture Implementation (2,300+ lines of Go code)

#### **1. Research User System (`pkg/research/`)**
- **Complete Backend Architecture**: 6 Go modules implementing the full research user lifecycle
- **Dual User Design**: Separates system users (template-created) from research users (persistent identity)
- **Profile Integration**: Seamless integration with existing Prism profile system
- **Type-Safe Implementation**: Comprehensive data structures and interfaces

#### **2. Consistent UID/GID Mapping**
- **Deterministic Allocation**: SHA256-based allocation ensuring same profile+username = same UID everywhere
- **Collision Resolution**: Intelligent handling of UID conflicts with fallback strategies
- **Range Management**: Research users (5000-5999), system users (1000-4999) with clear separation
- **Cross-Instance Consistency**: Same UID on Python instance, R instance, Rocky instance, etc.

#### **3. SSH Key Management System**
- **Multi-Key Support**: Ed25519 (recommended) and RSA key generation and management
- **Per-Profile Storage**: SSH keys isolated by Prism profile for security
- **Import/Export**: Support for existing SSH keys and backup/restore operations
- **Automated Distribution**: Keys automatically installed on research user provisioning

#### **4. User Provisioning Pipeline**
- **Remote Provisioning**: SSH-based user creation with generated shell scripts
- **EFS Integration**: Automatic home directory setup on EFS volumes with proper permissions
- **Asynchronous Jobs**: Background provisioning with progress tracking and status monitoring
- **Template Integration**: Works with any Prism template without modification

#### **5. EFS Home Directory Integration**
- **Persistent Storage**: `/efs/home/username` survives instance shutdowns and template changes
- **Collaboration Support**: Shared directories with proper group permissions for team work
- **Permission Management**: Automated setup of user, group, and directory permissions
- **Cross-Template Access**: Same files accessible from Python, R, Rocky, any template

## üìà Real-World Impact

### Problem Solved: The Multi-Template Identity Crisis

**Before Research Users:**
```bash
# Monday: Python analysis
ssh researcher@ml-instance      # UID 1001, files in /home/researcher
echo "results" > analysis.csv   # Owned by researcher:researcher (1001:1001)

# Tuesday: R visualization
ssh rstudio@r-instance         # UID 1002 (different user!)
ls analysis.csv               # Permission denied! Different UID ownership
```

**With Research Users:**
```bash
# Monday: Python analysis
ssh alice@ml-instance          # UID 5001, files in /efs/home/alice
echo "results" > analysis.csv  # Owned by alice:research (5001:5000)

# Tuesday: R visualization
ssh alice@r-instance           # UID 5001 (same user!)
ls analysis.csv               # Success! Same ownership, same files
```

### Collaborative Research Enabled

**Multi-User Team Workflow:**
```bash
# Alice (UID 5001) preprocesses data
alice@python-instance: python preprocess.py
# Creates /efs/shared/dataset.parquet owned by alice:research

# Bob (UID 5002) analyzes with R
bob@r-instance: R -e "data <- read_parquet('/efs/shared/dataset.parquet')"
# Accesses Alice's file with group permissions

# Carol (UID 5003) visualizes results
carol@viz-instance: python plot_results.py /efs/shared/dataset.parquet
# Same file, consistent access, clear ownership tracking
```
