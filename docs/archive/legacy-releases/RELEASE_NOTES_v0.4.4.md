## ‚ú® **What's New**

### üöÄ **Zero-Setup Experience**
- **Auto-creates intelligent default profile** that maps to user's `~/.aws/credentials` default profile
- **Works immediately**: `cws launch python-ml my-project` with zero configuration required
- **Perfect for researchers**: Install and launch - no profile management needed
- **Smart UX**: Shows users they're ready to go instead of asking for setup

### üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è **Interactive Profile Wizard**
- **Professional 500-line profile wizard** for advanced multi-account scenarios
- **AWS credential validation** with real-time testing during profile creation
- **Auto-detection** of AWS profiles from `~/.aws/credentials`
- **Educational guidance** with colored output and clear messaging
- **Only presented** when users want additional profiles beyond default

### üìä **Real-Time Progress Reporting**
- **Visual progress bars** with accurate time estimation based on template type
- **Cost tracking** during instance launches with real-time updates
- **Template-aware progress stages** (AMI vs package-based installations)
- **Professional completion and error reporting** with actionable next steps
- **Smart monitoring** with educational progress messaging

### üîß **Contextual Error System**
- **Strategy Pattern error handlers** for different error categories (daemon, profile, launch, keychain)
- **Actionable suggestions** instead of cryptic error messages
- **User-friendly formatting** that guides users to success
- **Educational error messages** that help users understand and fix issues
- **Comprehensive coverage** across all CLI commands

## üé≠ **User Experience Transformation**

### **Before v0.4.4:**
```bash
# Users had to create profiles manually
cws profiles setup
cws profiles add personal my-work --aws-profile default
cws profiles switch [profile-id]
cws launch python-ml my-project
```

### **After v0.4.4:**
```bash
# Just works immediately
cws launch python-ml my-project
```

### **Documentation Impact**
- ‚úÖ **New approach**: "Run `cws launch python-ml my-project` to get started"
- ‚ùå **Old approach**: ~~"First create a profile with `cws profiles setup`"~~
