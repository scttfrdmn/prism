   - Required: Console federation URL generation
   - Complexity: MEDIUM

5. **Line 203: handleWebProxy** - Enhanced CORS for embedding
   - Current: Placeholder response
   - Required: Enhanced proxy with CORS headers
   - Complexity: LOW

## Priority 3: Storage & Data Management (MEDIUM)

### pkg/storage/manager.go
- **Line: "For now, return a simplified version"**
- Context: Storage analysis
- Current: Simplified placeholder
- Required: Complete storage analysis implementation
- Complexity: MEDIUM

### pkg/connection/reliability.go
- **Sliding window** - Connection reliability tracking
- Current: Comment about sliding window
- Required: Actual sliding window implementation for connection metrics
- Complexity: LOW

---

## Priority 6: Marketplace & Templates (LOW-MEDIUM)

### pkg/marketplace/registry.go
Multiple DynamoDB placeholders:
- **Line: DynamoDB query** - "In production, this would query DynamoDB"
- **Line: DynamoDB fetch** - "In production, this would fetch from DynamoDB"
- **Line: Template sorting** - "For now, return based on recent downloads"
- **Line: DynamoDB update** - "In production, this would update DynamoDB"
- **Line: Reviews storage** - "In production, this would store in DynamoDB reviews table"
- **Line: Reviews query** - "In production, this would query DynamoDB reviews table"
- **Line: Mock reviews** - "For now, return mock reviews"
- **Line: Analytics writing** - "In production, this would write to analytics storage"
- **Line: User attribution** - "current-user" placeholder
- **Line: Analytics aggregation** - "In production, this would aggregate from analytics storage"
- **Line: Analytics query** - "In production, this would query analytics data"
- **Line: Template integration** - "In production, this would integrate with existing template system"
- **Line: AMI integration** - "In production, this would integrate with AMI creation system"

Current: All return mock/placeholder data
Required: DynamoDB integration for marketplace data
Complexity: HIGH (requires DynamoDB schema design)
Decision: May defer marketplace to later phase - this is a complex feature

### pkg/daemon/template_application_handlers.go
- **Line: "For now, return a placeholder"**
- Context: Template configuration
- Required: Real template configuration based on application context
- Complexity: LOW

---

## Priority 7: Project Management (LOW)

- **Line: "In a real implementation, we would query AWS for actual usage"**
- Current: Placeholder comments
- Required: AWS Cost Explorer API integration
- Complexity: MEDIUM

### pkg/project/manager.go
- **Line: "For now, return empty slice"**
- Context: Project operations
- Current: Returns empty slice
- Required: Actual project data retrieval
- Complexity: LOW

---

## Priority 8: Web Services (LOW)

### pkg/web/terminal.go
- **Line: "In a real implementation, you would upgrade to WebSocket here"**
- Current: Placeholder comment
- Required: WebSocket upgrade implementation
- Complexity: LOW (gorilla/websocket)

## Summary Statistics

**Total Fake Implementations**: 40+
**Completed**: 6 (15%)
**High Priority**: 8
**Medium Priority**: 15
**Low Priority**: 17

**Estimated Effort**:
- High Priority: 60 hours (SSH proxy, DCV, security)
- Medium Priority: 40 hours (monitoring, cost tracking, storage)
- Low Priority: 20 hours (minor placeholders)
- **Total**: ~120 hours

---

## Recommended Approach

1. **Security First**: Fix SSH host key verification (CRITICAL)
2. **Monitoring**: Implement platform-specific health monitoring
3. **Cost Tracking**: Complete CloudWatch metrics integration
4. **Storage**: Finish storage analysis
5. **Marketplace**: Defer to Phase 6 (requires DynamoDB architecture)
6. **Proxy Handlers**: Implement based on actual use cases

---

## Testing Requirements

For EACH implementation:
1. Unit tests written
2. Integration tests with AWS (AWS_PROFILE=aws, AWS_REGION=us-west-2)
3. Error handling tested
4. Documentation updated
5. No "TODO", "FIXME", or placeholder comments remaining

*This document tracks ALL fake implementations. Update as items are completed.*
