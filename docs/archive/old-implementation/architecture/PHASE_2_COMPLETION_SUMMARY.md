## 🏗️ Architectural Achievements

### Multi-Modal Access Strategy
Prism now provides three complete, synchronized interfaces:

```
┌─────────────┐  ┌─────────────┐  ┌─────────────┐
│ CLI Client  │  │ TUI Client  │  │ GUI Client  │
│ (cmd/cws)   │  │ (prism tui)   │  │ (cmd/cws-gui)│
└──────┬──────┘  └──────┬──────┘  └──────┬──────┘
       │                │                │
       └────────────────┼────────────────┘
                        │
                 ┌─────────────┐
                 │ Backend     │
                 │ Daemon      │
                 │ (cwsd:8947) │
                 └─────────────┘
```

**Benefits:**
- **Unified State**: All interfaces share same daemon backend
- **Real-time Sync**: Changes reflect across all interfaces immediately  
- **Consistent Configuration**: Shared profile and AWS credential management
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Simple CLI → Interactive TUI → Visual GUI
