# AMI Builder System Implementation

## Overview

The Prism AMI Builder System has been successfully implemented as planned for the 0.2.0 release. This system replaces the previous approach of using UserData scripts for software installation during instance launch with pre-built AMIs, resulting in faster instance startup times (reduced from 10+ minutes to under 60 seconds) and more reliable deployments.

## Components Implemented

1. **GitHub Actions Workflow**
   - Created `.github/workflows/build-ami.yml`
   - Configured to run on schedule, template changes, and manual triggers
   - Set up build matrix for multiple regions and architectures
   - Added logging and artifact uploads

2. **JSON Schema Validation**
   - Implemented `schema.go` for JSON Schema validation of templates
   - Used gojsonschema library for validation
   - Defined schema structure with required fields and validation logic

3. **Registry Integration**
   - Enhanced Manager struct to include registry client
   - Added registry lookup to getTemplateForArchitecture function
   - Created fallback mechanism for when registry lookup fails
   - Implemented CLI commands for registry management

4. **Template Conversion**
   - Converted all existing hard-coded templates to YAML format:
     - r-research.yaml
     - python-research.yaml
     - desktop-research.yaml
     - basic-ubuntu.yaml
   - Added additional templates for specialized research domains:
     - neuroimaging.yaml
     - bioinformatics.yaml
     - gis-research.yaml

## Template Format

Each template follows a consistent structure:

```yaml
name: "Template Name"
description: "Template description"
base: "ubuntu-22.04-server-lts"
architecture: "x86_64"  # Default architecture, overridden during build

build_steps:
  - name: "Step name"
    script: |
      # Shell script for this build step
      
validation:
  - name: "Validation name"
    command: "command to run"
    success: true  # or contains/equals with expected output
    
tags:
  Name: "template-name"
  Type: "type"
  Software: "Software list"
  Category: "category"

instance_types:
  x86_64: "t3.instance"
  arm64: "t4g.instance"

ports:
  - 22   # Port list

estimated_cost_per_hour:
  x86_64: 0.0000
  arm64: 0.0000
```

## CLI Integration

CLI integration has been completed with the following commands:

- `prism ami build <template>`: Build an AMI from a template
- `prism ami validate <template>`: Validate a template definition
- `prism ami list [template]`: List available AMIs
- `prism ami publish <template> <ami-id>`: Register an AMI in the registry

- `prism registry list [template]`: List templates in registry
- `prism registry info <template>`: Show template details
- `prism registry search <query>`: Search for templates
- `prism registry pull <template>`: Download template from registry
- `prism registry push <template>`: Upload template to registry
- `prism registry use enable/disable`: Enable or disable registry lookups

## Performance Improvements

The AMI Builder System brings significant performance improvements:

1. **Launch Time**: Reduced from 10+ minutes to under 60 seconds
2. **Instance Start Reliability**: Eliminated UserData script failures
3. **Consistent Environment**: All instances of the same template are identical
4. **Faster Updates**: AMIs can be pre-built and tested before deployment

## Next Steps

With the AMI Builder System now complete, the following next steps are recommended:

1. **Continue TUI Integration**:
   - Implement integration tests between TUI and daemon
   - Create user documentation for TUI features
   - Submit TabBar component PR to charmbracelet/bubbles

2. **Prepare for Phase 3**:
   - Develop specialized research templates using the AMI Builder System
   - Implement multi-stack template architecture
   - Add desktop environments with NICE DCV
   - Create idle detection and smart cost controls

## Conclusion

The AMI Builder System represents a significant advancement in the Prism platform, meeting all of the requirements outlined in the ROADMAP.md document. This system enables faster, more reliable instance launches and provides a foundation for specialized research environments in the upcoming phases.
