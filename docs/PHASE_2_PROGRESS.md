# Phase 2 Progress: Template Application Engine

## Overview

Phase 2 focused on implementing the ability to apply templates to already running CloudWorkstation instances, addressing the roadmap question: "Can I run a template on an already defined and running cloudworkstation?"

This represents a major architectural advancement, transforming CloudWorkstation from a simple VM launcher into a sophisticated "infrastructure as code" research platform.
