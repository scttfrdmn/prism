# CloudWorkstation Roadmap: v0.4.2 → v0.5.0

## Overview

Strategic roadmap for CloudWorkstation development between the next minor release (v0.4.2) and the major multi-user architecture release (v0.5.0). This phase focuses on desktop integration, cross-platform support, and distribution channel expansion.

## Post-v0.4.2 Development Priorities

### 🖥️ **Priority 1: Desktop Versions with Remote NICE DCV Connectivity**

**Objective**: Transform CloudWorkstation from CLI-focused tool into comprehensive desktop research platform with seamless remote GUI access.

**Key Features**:
- **NICE DCV Integration**: Native DCV client integration for high-performance remote desktop
- **Automatic Connection Management**: One-click desktop access to running instances
- **Smart Reconnection**: Automatic reconnection with session persistence
- **Idle Detection & Restart**: Monitor connection health and restart when needed
- **Multi-Display Support**: Handle multiple monitors and resolution changes

**Technical Implementation**:
```bash
# Enhanced desktop connectivity commands
cws desktop connect my-ml-workstation    # Launch DCV session automatically
cws desktop reconnect my-ml-workstation  # Restore dropped connections
cws desktop status                       # Show active desktop sessions

# Template integration for desktop environments
cws launch ubuntu-desktop my-workstation --desktop
# ↳ Auto-installs desktop environment + DCV server
# ↳ Launches with desktop connectivity ready
```

**Architecture Components**:
- **DCV Server Templates**: Enhanced templates with desktop environments and DCV server
- **Native DCV Client**: Embedded DCV client in GUI application
- **Connection Monitoring**: Background service for connection health and auto-restart
- **Session Management**: Persistent desktop sessions with state preservation

**Desktop Template Examples**:
- `Ubuntu Desktop + ML Tools`: Full Ubuntu desktop with ML/AI research stack
- `Rocky Linux Desktop + HPC`: CentOS-style desktop for HPC research workflows
- `Windows Server Desktop`: Windows-based research environments (future)

### 🪟 **Priority 2: Windows 11 Client Support & Distribution**

**Objective**: Bring CloudWorkstation's full functionality to Windows 11 with native installation experience.

**Research Areas**:
- **Go Cross-Compilation**: Verify Windows builds for daemon, CLI, and GUI
- **Windows Service Integration**: Native Windows service for daemon
- **Installation Strategy**: Choose between MSI, NSIS, or Windows Package Manager
- **GUI Framework**: Validate Fyne cross-platform compatibility on Windows 11
- **Path & Registry**: Windows-specific configuration and AWS profile integration

**Distribution Options to Evaluate**:

1. **Windows Package Manager (winget)**:
   ```powershell
   winget install CloudWorkstation.CLI
   winget install CloudWorkstation.Desktop
   ```
   - Pros: Native Windows 11 integration, automatic updates
   - Cons: Package submission process, Microsoft certification

2. **Chocolatey Package**:
   ```powershell
   choco install cloudworkstation
   ```
   - Pros: Popular in developer community, easy distribution
   - Cons: Third-party dependency, less corporate-friendly

3. **MSI Installer with Auto-Updates**:
   ```
   CloudWorkstation-0.4.2-x64.msi
   ```
   - Pros: Enterprise-friendly, Group Policy support
   - Cons: Complex build pipeline, code signing requirements

4. **Scoop Package**:
   ```powershell
   scoop bucket add cloudworkstation https://github.com/org/scoop-bucket
   scoop install cloudworkstation
   ```
   - Pros: Developer-focused, JSON-based configuration
   - Cons: Smaller user base than winget/chocolatey

**Implementation Plan**:
- **Phase 1**: Cross-compile and test all components on Windows 11
- **Phase 2**: Research installation frameworks and choose optimal approach
- **Phase 3**: Implement Windows-specific daemon service and GUI integration
- **Phase 4**: Create automated build pipeline for Windows releases

### 📦 **Priority 3: Conda Distribution Channel Research**

**Objective**: Evaluate conda as alternative distribution method for CloudWorkstation, especially for data science and research communities.

**Research Questions**:

1. **Target Audience Alignment**:
   - Does conda align with CloudWorkstation's research computing focus?
   - Would researchers prefer `conda install cloudworkstation` over other methods?
   - How does conda fit with AWS CLI and research workflow integration?

2. **Technical Feasibility**:
   - Can Go binaries be effectively packaged in conda environments?
   - How would conda handle daemon service management across platforms?
   - What dependencies would be required (AWS CLI, docker, etc.)?

3. **Distribution Strategy**:
   - **conda-forge**: Community-driven, high trust, broad reach
   - **Private channel**: Organization-controlled, custom metadata
   - **Anaconda.com**: Commercial platform, potential licensing considerations

**Conda Package Structure Research**:
```yaml
# Potential conda package structure
package:
  name: cloudworkstation
  version: "0.4.2"

requirements:
  build:
    - go >=1.19
  run:
    - aws-cli >=2.0
    - ca-certificates

about:
  home: https://github.com/org/cloudworkstation
  summary: "Launch pre-configured cloud workstations for research computing"
  description: "Command-line tool for academic researchers to launch..."
  license: MIT
```

**Evaluation Criteria**:
- **User Experience**: Is `conda install cloudworkstation` intuitive for researchers?
- **Maintenance Overhead**: How much additional work is conda packaging?
- **Platform Coverage**: Does conda cover all target platforms effectively?
- **Update Mechanisms**: How do conda updates integrate with CloudWorkstation's versioning?
- **Dependency Management**: Can conda handle AWS CLI and other system dependencies?

**Research Methodology**:
1. **Survey existing Go packages** in conda-forge for patterns and best practices
2. **Prototype basic conda package** for CloudWorkstation CLI
3. **Test cross-platform builds** through conda-build system
4. **Evaluate user workflows** with conda vs. current installation methods
5. **Assess maintenance burden** for ongoing conda package updates
