## Release Timeline & Development Schedule

### **Total Development Time: ~54-66 weeks (12-15 months to v0.5.0)**

| Release | Duration | Focus | Key Deliverables |
|---------|----------|-------|------------------|
| **v0.4.3** | 4-6 weeks | Foundation & Research | Research reports, prototypes, enhanced build pipeline |
| **v0.4.4** | 6-8 weeks | Desktop Connectivity | NICE DCV integration, desktop templates |
| **v0.4.5** | 6-8 weeks | Windows 11 Support | Windows client, service integration, package managers |
| **v0.4.6** | 4-6 weeks | Enhanced Distribution | conda-forge, APT/DNF packages, research community integration |

| **v0.5.0** | 12-16 weeks | Multi-User Architecture | Centralized identity, team collaboration, enterprise integration |

### **Development Approach**
- **Parallel Development**: Some releases can be developed concurrently (e.g., v0.4.5 Windows + v0.4.6 Distribution)
- **Early User Feedback**: Each sub-release gets user testing and feedback before next release
- **Incremental Value**: Each version delivers immediate value to users
- **Risk Mitigation**: Complex features (networking, sync) get dedicated releases for thorough testing

### **Release Cadence Options**

#### **Option A: Sequential Release (54-66 weeks total)**
- **Pros**: Thorough testing, focused development, lower risk
- **Cons**: Longer time to full feature set, delayed user feedback

#### **Option B: Parallel Development (36-44 weeks total)**
- **Pros**: Faster delivery, early user adoption, concurrent feedback
- **Cons**: Higher complexity, increased testing burden, resource requirements

#### **Option C: MVP + Iteration (24-32 weeks to functional v0.5.0)**
- Focus on core features first (v0.4.4, v0.4.5, v0.5.0), defer enhancements
- **Pros**: Fastest path to multi-user platform, early market validation
- **Cons**: Missing some advanced features initially

### **üéØ Recommended Approach: Option B (Parallel Development)**

**Rationale**:
- **User Impact**: Desktop connectivity (v0.4.4) and Windows support (v0.4.5) can be developed concurrently for maximum user base expansion
- **Risk Management**: Research phase (v0.4.3) informs all subsequent development, reducing technical risk
- **Market Positioning**: Enhanced distribution (v0.4.6) supports growing user base from desktop/Windows releases
- **Strategic Value**: Security features (v0.4.7) and sync (v0.4.8) provide competitive differentiation before multi-user launch

**Parallel Development Streams**:
1. **Stream A**: Desktop & Windows (v0.4.4 + v0.4.5) - 8-10 weeks parallel
2. **Stream B**: Distribution & Networking (v0.4.6 + v0.4.7) - 10-12 weeks parallel  
3. **Stream C**: Sync & Multi-User (v0.4.8 + v0.5.0) - 16-20 weeks sequential

**Total Timeline**: 36-44 weeks (8-10 months to v0.5.0)
