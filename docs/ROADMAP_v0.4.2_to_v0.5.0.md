**Technical Implementation**:
```bash
# Enhanced desktop connectivity commands
cws desktop connect my-ml-workstation    # Launch DCV session automatically
cws desktop reconnect my-ml-workstation  # Restore dropped connections
cws desktop status                       # Show active desktop sessions

# Template integration for desktop environments
cws launch ubuntu-desktop my-workstation --desktop
# ‚Ü≥ Auto-installs desktop environment + DCV server
# ‚Ü≥ Launches with desktop connectivity ready
```

**Architecture Components**:

   - Cons: Third-party dependency, less corporate-friendly

3. **MSI Installer with Auto-Updates**:
   ```
   CloudWorkstation-0.4.2-x64.msi
   ```
   - Pros: Enterprise-friendly, Group Policy support
   - Cons: Complex build pipeline, code signing requirements

4. **Scoop Package**:
   ```powershell
   scoop bucket add cloudworkstation https://github.com/org/scoop-bucket
   scoop install cloudworkstation
   ```
   - Pros: Developer-focused, JSON-based configuration
