## üì¶ Features & Issues

### 1. Issue #14: Merge Terminal/WebView into Workspaces
**Priority**: P0 (Core navigation simplification)
**Effort**: Large (3-4 days)
**Impact**: Critical (Reduces navigation by 2 items)

**Current State**:
```
Navigation:
- Workspaces (list view)
- Terminal (SSH connection)
- WebView (Jupyter/RStudio access)
```

**Proposed State**:
```
Navigation:
- Workspaces (integrated view)
  ‚îî‚îÄ Each workspace card shows:
     - Status, cost, uptime
     - Quick actions: Connect (SSH/Web), Stop, Terminate
     - Expandable: Connection details, logs, metrics
```

**Implementation**:

#### Phase 1: Workspace Detail Component
```typescript
// cmd/prism-gui/frontend/src/components/WorkspaceDetail.tsx
interface WorkspaceDetailProps {
  workspace: Workspace;
  onConnect: (method: 'ssh' | 'web') => void;
  onAction: (action: 'stop' | 'start' | 'hibernate' | 'terminate') => void;
}

Sections:
- Header: Name, status badge, actions dropdown
- Connection Options:
  - SSH: Command to copy, or click to launch terminal
  - Web Services: Jupyter/RStudio/VSCode buttons
  - Port forwarding: List of exposed ports
- Details Accordion:
  - Configuration (template, size, region)
  - Cost (current session, lifetime, estimate)
  - Storage (attached EFS/EBS volumes)
  - Logs (recent activity, errors)
  - Metrics (CPU, memory, network - if available)
```

#### Phase 2: Integrated Terminal Component
```typescript
// cmd/prism-gui/frontend/src/components/IntegratedTerminal.tsx
Features:
- Embedded xterm.js terminal

  ‚îú‚îÄ Profiles
  ‚îú‚îÄ Users
  ‚îú‚îÄ Advanced
  ‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ AMI Management
  ‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ Idle Detection  
  ‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ System
  ‚îî‚îÄ About
```

**Implementation**:

#### Phase 1: Settings Navigation Structure
```typescript
// cmd/prism-gui/frontend/src/pages/Settings.tsx
interface SettingsPage {
  sections: SettingsSection[];
}

interface SettingsSection {
  id: string;
  label: string;
  icon: string;
  component: React.ComponentType;
  visible: (user: User) => boolean;  // Role-based visibility
}

Sections:
- General: App preferences, theme, language
- Profiles: AWS profile management
- Users: Research user management (admin only)
- Advanced:
  - AMI Management (admin only)
  - Idle Detection: Configure hibernation policies
  - System: Daemon settings, logs, diagnostics
- About: Version, docs links, support
```

#### Phase 2: Role-Based Visibility
```typescript
// Only show admin sections to admins
function isVisible(section: SettingsSection, user: User): boolean {
  switch (section.id) {
    case 'ami':
    case 'users':
      return user.isAdmin;
    default:
      return true;
  }
}
```

#### Phase 3: Cloudscape SideNavigation
```typescript
// Use Cloudscape SideNavigation component
<SideNavigation
  activeHref={activeSection}
  header={{ text: "Settings", href: "/settings" }}
  items={[
    { type: "link", text: "General", href: "/settings/general" },
    { type: "link", text: "Profiles", href: "/settings/profiles" },
    { 
      type: "expandable-link-group",
      text: "Advanced",
      items: [
        { type: "link", text: "AMI Management", href: "/settings/ami" },
        { type: "link", text: "Idle Detection", href: "/settings/idle" },
        { type: "link", text: "System", href: "/settings/system" }
      ]
    }
  ]}
/>
```

**Migration**:

- Storage: EFS (shared filesystems)
- Volumes: EBS (block storage)

**Proposed State**:
- Storage: Unified view of all storage
  - Types: Shared (EFS), Workspace (EBS), S3 (future)
  - Filters: By type, by workspace, by project

**Implementation**:

```typescript
// cmd/prism-gui/frontend/src/pages/Storage.tsx
interface StorageItem {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  type: 'efs' | 'ebs' | 's3';  // Extensible for future
  size: number;
  cost: number;
  attachedTo?: string[];  // Workspace IDs
  status: 'available' | 'in-use' | 'creating' | 'error';

**API Integration**:
- GET `/api/v1/storage` - Unified storage list
- POST `/api/v1/storage` - Create (type-specific)
- PUT `/api/v1/storage/{id}/attach` - Attach to workspace
- DELETE `/api/v1/storage/{id}` - Delete storage

**Testing**:
