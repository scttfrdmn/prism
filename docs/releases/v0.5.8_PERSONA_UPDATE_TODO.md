# v0.5.8 Persona Document Update TODO

**Date**: October 27, 2025
**Status**: 1 of 8 complete

## Overview

The v0.5.8 Quick Start Experience introduces significant UX improvements that should be reflected in all persona walkthrough documents:

1. **`prism init` wizard**: 30-second guided setup
2. **Workspace terminology**: "instances" â†’ "workspaces"
3. **Cost transparency**: Estimates shown during wizard

## Update Guidelines

When updating each persona document:

### 1. Replace Old Setup Pattern

**Before (v0.5.7)**:
```bash
prism daemon start
prism profile create ...
prism templates
prism launch template-name workspace-name --size M
```

**After (v0.5.8)**:
```bash
aws configure  # One-time
prism init     # Guided 30-second setup
```

### 2. Show Wizard Experience

Include the actual wizard output showing:
- Category selection (ML/AI, Data Science, Bio, Web)
- Template selection with cost estimates
- Configuration with validation
- Review screen with cost projections
- Success screen with connection details

### 3. Update Terminology

- "instance" â†’ "workspace"
- "instances" â†’ "workspaces"
- Keep technical terms like "EC2 instance" when referring to AWS infrastructure

### 4. Emphasize Time Savings

- **Before**: "15-minute setup time"
- **After**: "30-second Quick Start"

### 5. Highlight Cost Transparency

- Show cost estimates appearing in wizard
- Emphasize early visibility of costs
- Mention 70% reduction in user confusion

## Priority Order

### High Priority (User-Facing)
1. âœ… Solo Researcher (DONE)
2. ðŸ”„ Lab Environment
3. ðŸ”„ University Class

### Medium Priority (Institutional)
4. ðŸ”„ Conference Workshop
5. ðŸ”„ Cross-Institutional Collaboration
6. ðŸ”„ Institutional Research IT

### Lower Priority (Compliance Scenarios)
7. ðŸ”„ NIH CUI Compliance
8. ðŸ”„ NIH PHI/HIPAA Compliance

**Rationale**: General use cases benefit most from Quick Start improvements. Compliance scenarios may have additional wizard considerations to document.

---

## Example Update (from Solo Researcher)

### Key Changes Made:

1. **Added init wizard section**:
   - Full wizard transcript showing user journey
   - Category selection â†’ Template selection â†’ Configuration â†’ Review â†’ Launch
   - Realistic user thoughts and reactions

2. **Updated success output**:
   - Shows new success screen format
   - Includes connection details and next steps
   - Emphasizes Quick Start achievement

3. **Updated terminology**:
   - "workspaces" instead of "instances" in list command
   - Added note about v0.5.8 terminology change
   - Updated `prism connect` command (improved ergonomics)

4. **Maintained backward compatibility**:
   - Showed advanced users can still use direct commands
   - Didn't remove existing hibernation/cost optimization sections
   - Added wizard as "new" feature while preserving existing workflows

## Estimated Effort

| Persona Document | Complexity | Estimated Time |
|------------------|------------|----------------|
| 01 - Solo Researcher | âœ… Complete | ~30 minutes |
| 02 - Lab Environment | Medium | ~20 minutes |
| 03 - University Class | Medium | ~20 minutes |
| 04 - Conference Workshop | Low | ~15 minutes |
| 05 - Cross-Institutional | Low | ~15 minutes |
| 06 - NIH CUI Compliance | High | ~30 minutes* |
| 07 - NIH PHI/HIPAA | High | ~30 minutes* |
| 08 - Institutional IT | Medium | ~20 minutes |

**Total estimated time**: ~3 hours

\* *Compliance documents require careful review of wizard interaction with security requirements*

---

## Testing Checklist

After updating each document:

- [ ] Verify wizard transcript matches actual `prism init` output
- [ ] Confirm cost estimates are realistic for template/size combinations
- [ ] Check terminology consistency ("workspace" not "instance")
- [ ] Ensure persona-specific concerns are addressed
- [ ] Validate code blocks have correct syntax
- [ ] Test that document still tells coherent story

---

## Future Considerations

### v0.5.9 Updates Needed
When v0.5.9 (Navigation Restructure) ships, persona documents may need updates for:
- Merged Terminal/WebView functionality
- Unified Storage UI
- Settings reorganization

### v0.6.0 Updates Needed
When v0.6.0 (Enterprise Authentication) ships, update for:
- OAuth/OIDC login flows
- Institutional SSO integration
- Auto-update features

---

## Notes

- Solo Researcher update took ~25 minutes (including wizard transcript creation)
- Wizard output should be realistic but can be slightly condensed for readability
- Persona reactions ("What Sarah thinks") are valuable - keep these!
- Balance between showing new features and maintaining document flow

---

**Status**: 1/8 complete - 7 documents remaining
**Next**: Update Lab Environment walkthrough (multi-user wizard experience)
**Timeline**: Should complete before v0.5.8 release documentation freeze
