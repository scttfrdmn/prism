# Prism v0.5.13 Release Plan: UX Re-evaluation & Polish

**Release Date**: Target May 2026
**Focus**: Comprehensive UX review and refinement after major feature implementations

## üéØ Release Goals

### Primary Objective
Pause feature development to evaluate the cumulative UX impact of v0.5.9-v0.5.12, ensuring the product remains intuitive, coherent, and aligned with our [5 persona walkthroughs](../USER_SCENARIOS/).

**Why This Release Is Critical**:
- We've added 4 major feature sets (navigation, budgets, invitations, rate limiting)
- Each feature was designed well in isolation, but do they work together?
- Have we maintained our core design principle of "Progressive Disclosure"?
- Are new users still achieving "workspace in 30 seconds"?
- Do the 5 personas still have clear, simple workflows?

### Success Metrics
- ‚è±Ô∏è Time to first workspace: Still <30 seconds (regression test)
- üß≠ Navigation efficiency: Average <3 clicks to any feature
- üòÉ User confusion: <10% of support tickets are UX-related
- üì± Feature discoverability: >95% of users find features without help
- üéØ Workflow completion: All 5 personas complete tasks without friction

## üí° Philosophy

This release embodies our commitment to **user-centered design**. We're not adding features‚Äîwe're ensuring the features we've built actually serve our users effectively.

**Core Principle**: "A feature is only valuable if users can find it, understand it, and use it successfully."

This release is our opportunity to:
- Validate our design decisions with real usage patterns
- Course-correct any UX missteps
- Polish the rough edges
- Ensure coherence across the product
- Prepare a solid foundation for v0.6.0 enterprise features

**Target Users**: This release directly benefits all 5 personas but especially:
1. **New users**: Improved onboarding and discoverability
2. **Administrators**: Clearer multi-project management
3. **Instructors**: Validated bulk operation workflows
4. **Researchers**: Streamlined daily workflows
