# CloudWorkstation School Pilot Quick Start Guide

*Last Updated: October 2025 â€¢ Version 0.5.5*

## ðŸŽ¯ For Educational Institutions & School Pilots

This guide is specifically designed for educational institutions evaluating CloudWorkstation for their computing curriculum, research programs, and student projects. CloudWorkstation enables schools to provide students with professional-grade development environments without the complexity of traditional IT infrastructure.

## ðŸ“š What is CloudWorkstation?

CloudWorkstation is an academic research platform that launches pre-configured cloud environments in seconds. Students and educators can access professional development tools, research environments, and collaborative workspaces through a simple interface - no IT expertise required.

**Perfect for:**
- Computer science courses and labs
- Data science and research projects
- Student coding assignments and portfolios
- Faculty research collaboration
- Cross-curricular technology integration

## âš¡ 5-Minute School Setup

### Step 1: Install CloudWorkstation

**For IT Administrators (Recommended)**
```bash
# Install via Homebrew (macOS/Linux)
brew tap scttfrdmn/cloudworkstation
brew install cloudworkstation

# Or download directly
curl -L https://github.com/scttfrdmn/cloudworkstation/releases/latest/download/cloudworkstation-darwin-arm64.tar.gz
```

**For Individual Educators**
- Download from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/scttfrdmn/cloudworkstation/releases)
- Choose your platform: macOS, Linux, or Windows
- Extract and run - no complex installation required

### Step 2: AWS Account Setup (One-time per School)

CloudWorkstation uses AWS for cloud resources. Most schools can use AWS Educate for credits:

1. **Get AWS Account**:
   - Apply for [AWS Educate](https://aws.amazon.com/education/awseducate/) (free credits for schools)
   - Or use existing institutional AWS account
   - Individual educators can use personal AWS accounts for pilot testing

2. **Configure Credentials** (IT Admin):
```bash
# Install AWS CLI
brew install awscli  # or: pip install awscli

# Configure institutional credentials
aws configure
# AWS Access Key ID: [Your school's access key]
# AWS Secret Access Key: [Your school's secret key]
# Default region: us-west-2 (or closest to your location)
# Output format: json
```

### Step 3: Launch Your First Environment

**For Students/Educators** (Web Interface):
```bash
# Start the GUI application
cws-gui
```

**For Command Line Users**:
```bash
# View available templates
cws templates

# Launch a Python environment for data science
cws launch "Python Machine Learning" my-first-project

# Launch an R environment for statistics
cws launch "R Research Environment" statistics-project

# Launch basic Ubuntu for general computing
cws launch "Basic Ubuntu (APT)" cs-assignment
```

## ðŸŽ“ Educational Templates

CloudWorkstation includes pre-configured environments designed for educational use:

### **Python Machine Learning**
- **Best for**: Data science courses, AI/ML projects, research
- **Includes**: TensorFlow, PyTorch, Jupyter notebooks, pandas, scikit-learn
- **Launch time**: ~2 minutes
- **Cost**: ~$0.48/hour (AWS t3.medium)

### **R Research Environment**
- **Best for**: Statistics courses, data analysis, research projects
- **Includes**: RStudio, tidyverse, statistical packages
- **Launch time**: ~3 minutes
- **Cost**: ~$0.24/hour (AWS t3.small)

### **Basic Ubuntu (APT)**
- **Best for**: Computer science fundamentals, programming courses
- **Includes**: Ubuntu Linux, development tools, package management
- **Launch time**: ~1 minute
- **Cost**: ~$0.12/hour (AWS t3.micro)

### **Web Development**
- **Best for**: Web design courses, full-stack development
- **Includes**: Node.js, Python, development tools, web servers
- **Launch time**: ~2 minutes
- **Cost**: ~$0.36/hour (AWS t3.small)

## ðŸ’° Cost Management for Schools

### Budget-Friendly Features
- **Automatic Hibernation**: Environments automatically pause when idle (preserves student work, minimal cost)
- **Spot Instances**: Use spare AWS capacity for 60-90% cost savings
- **Right-sizing**: Templates automatically choose cost-effective instance types
- **Usage Tracking**: Monitor spending across classes and projects

### Example Monthly Costs (30 hours of use per student):
- **Basic Ubuntu**: ~$3.60/student/month
- **Python ML Environment**: ~$14.40/student/month
- **R Research Environment**: ~$7.20/student/month

### Cost Optimization Tips:
```bash
# Enable hibernation for classes (preserves student work)
cws hibernate my-project  # Pause when not in use
cws resume my-project     # Resume with all work intact

# Use spot instances for assignments
cws launch "Python Machine Learning" assignment --spot

# Set up automatic hibernation policies
cws idle profile create classroom --idle-minutes 30 --action hibernate
```

## ðŸ‘¥ Classroom Management

### Multi-Student Support
```bash
# Launch environments for entire class
cws launch "Python Machine Learning" alice-ml-project
cws launch "Python Machine Learning" bob-ml-project
cws launch "Python Machine Learning" carol-ml-project

# Share files between students using EFS volumes
cws volume create class-shared-data
cws volume mount class-shared-data alice-ml-project
cws volume mount class-shared-data bob-ml-project
```

### Student Collaboration
- **Shared Storage**: Students can collaborate on projects through shared EFS volumes
- **Template Consistency**: All students use identical, professional environments
- **Easy Access**: Students connect via SSH or web-based tools (Jupyter, RStudio)

## ðŸ”§ Common Educational Workflows

### **Computer Science Course**
```bash
# Launch basic Ubuntu environment for each student
cws launch "Basic Ubuntu (APT)" student-cs101

# Students get full Linux environment with:
# - GCC compiler, Python, Node.js, Git
# - File system access and admin privileges
# - Pre-configured development tools
# - SSH access for remote development
```

### **Data Science Class**
```bash
# Launch Python ML environment with Jupyter
cws launch "Python Machine Learning" student-datascience

# Students access via web browser:
# - Jupyter notebooks at http://[instance-ip]:8888
# - Pre-installed ML libraries and datasets
# - GPU acceleration available for advanced projects
# - Collaborative notebooks through shared storage
```

### **Research Project**
```bash
# Create shared research environment
cws volume create research-project-data
cws launch "R Research Environment" professor-research
cws launch "Python Machine Learning" student-researcher

# Mount shared storage for collaboration
cws volume mount research-project-data professor-research
cws volume mount research-project-data student-researcher

# Both can access shared data and collaborate in real-time
```

## ðŸ”’ Security & Privacy for Schools

### Student Data Protection
- **Isolated Environments**: Each student gets private, isolated cloud environment
- **No Shared Infrastructure**: Students cannot access each other's work unless explicitly shared
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Environments can be automatically terminated at semester end
- **Backup Integration**: Student work automatically backed up to AWS EBS volumes

### FERPA Compliance
- **Private by Default**: Student environments are private and encrypted
- **Access Controls**: Only authorized faculty can manage student environments
- **Audit Logging**: Complete logs of all environment access and changes
- **Data Retention**: Configurable data retention policies for academic records

## ðŸš€ Advanced Features for Educators

### **Professional GUI Interface**
- **Visual Management**: Point-and-click interface for non-technical staff
- **Real-time Monitoring**: See all student environments and their status
- **Cost Dashboard**: Track usage and spending across classes
- **Template Marketplace**: Access community-contributed educational templates

### **Automated Management**
```bash
# Set up class-wide hibernation policies
cws idle profile create night-shutdown --idle-minutes 60 --action hibernate

# Apply to all student environments
cws idle bulk-apply night-shutdown cs101-*

# Automatic cost optimization without losing student work
```

### **Integration with LMS**
- **API Access**: Integrate with Canvas, Blackboard, Moodle via REST API
- **Single Sign-On**: Connect with school authentication systems (future)
- **Grade Integration**: Link projects with grading systems (future)
