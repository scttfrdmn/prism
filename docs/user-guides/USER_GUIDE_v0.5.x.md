üîç Resolving AMI for template: python-ml
‚úÖ Found optimized AMI: ami-0123456789abcdef0
üìà Performance: 4.2x faster launch (30s vs 6min)
üöÄ Launching with pre-built environment...

# Preview AMI resolution before launch
cws launch python-ml my-research --dry-run --show-ami-resolution
```

### 2. Explore AMI Options
```bash
# List available AMIs for templates
cws ami list --template python-ml
üìã Available AMIs for template: python-ml

Region: us-east-1
  ami-0123456789abcdef0  Python ML v2.1.0   (community)  ‚≠ê 4.8/5
  ami-0fedcba9876543210  Python ML v2.0.5   (official)   ‚≠ê 4.6/5

# Test AMI availability across regions
cws ami test python-ml --all-regions
```

### 3. Create and Share AMIs
```bash
# Create AMI from your optimized instance
cws ami create python-ml my-instance --name "My Python ML Setup"
üîß Creating AMI from instance: my-instance
‚úÖ AMI created: ami-0123456789abcdef0

## AMI System Deep Dive

### AMI Resolution Strategy

CloudWorkstation uses intelligent **multi-tier resolution** to find the best deployment method:

1. **Direct Mapping**: Region-specific AMI references (fastest - 30 seconds)
2. **Dynamic Search**: Pattern-based AMI discovery (45 seconds)
3. **Marketplace Integration**: AWS Marketplace AMI lookup (60 seconds)
4. **Cross-Region Intelligence**: Copy AMI from other regions (2 minutes)
5. **Script Fallback**: Traditional installation (5-8 minutes)

### Template AMI Configuration

Templates can now include AMI optimization:

```yaml
# Template with AMI optimization
name: "Python ML (Optimized)"
ami_config:
  strategy: "ami_preferred"  # Try AMI first, fallback to script
  ami_mappings:
    us-east-1: "ami-0123456789abcdef0"
    us-west-2: "ami-0fedcba9876543210"
  fallback_strategy: "script_provisioning"
  preferred_architecture: "arm64"  # Cost optimization
```

### Understanding AMI Strategies

| Strategy | Behavior | Use Case |
|----------|----------|----------|
| `ami_preferred` | Try AMI first, fallback to script | **Recommended**: Balance speed and reliability |
| `ami_required` | AMI only, fail if unavailable | Critical applications requiring exact environments |
| `ami_fallback` | Script first, AMI if script fails | Legacy templates transitioning to AMI |

## Advanced Features

### Cross-Region Deployment

When AMIs aren't available in your region:

```bash
# Automatic cross-region resolution
cws launch python-ml my-research --region ap-south-1
üîç Resolving AMI in ap-south-1...
‚ùå No AMI in ap-south-1
üîÑ Searching fallback regions...
‚úÖ Found AMI in ap-southeast-1: ami-0xyz123456789def0
üìã Cross-region copy required (2 minutes + $0.03)
Continue? [y/N]: y
```

### Performance Optimization

CloudWorkstation automatically optimizes for:
- **Architecture**: ARM64 preferred for cost savings
- **Instance Types**: Match AMI optimizations to instance families
- **Regional Costs**: Consider data transfer for cross-region copies
- **Launch Speed**: Prioritize faster deployment for interactive work

### Cost Management

Understanding AMI costs:

```bash
# Compare deployment costs
cws launch python-ml my-research --dry-run --show-costs
üí∞ Cost Analysis:

AMI Launch:
  Instance: $0.45/hour (immediate availability)
  AMI Storage: $0.01/month (shared across launches)

Script Launch:
  Instance: $0.45/hour + 6min setup cost ($0.045)
  No storage costs

Recommendation: AMI launch saves time and reduces setup costs
```

## Community AMI System

### AMI Best Practices

**Creating High-Quality AMIs**:
1. **Test Thoroughly**: Launch from your AMI multiple times
2. **Document Changes**: Clear description of customizations
3. **Security Review**: Remove sensitive data and credentials
4. **Performance Optimize**: Include only necessary software
5. **Multi-Region**: Deploy to popular research regions

**Using Community AMIs**:
1. **Check Ratings**: Prefer highly-rated, well-reviewed AMIs
2. **Verify Source**: Trust reputable creators and institutions
3. **Test First**: Try AMI in development before production use
4. **Stay Updated**: Monitor for updated versions
5. **Provide Feedback**: Rate and review AMIs you use

## Troubleshooting AMI Issues

### Common Issues and Solutions

**AMI Not Available in Region**:
```bash
# Check cross-region options
cws ami test python-ml --region eu-central-1
‚ùå No direct AMI in eu-central-1
‚úÖ Available in eu-west-1 (copy cost: $0.02, time: 90s)
‚ö†Ô∏è  Fallback to script provisioning available (6 minutes)
```

**Slow AMI Resolution**:
```bash
# Force specific resolution method
cws launch python-ml my-research --ami-strategy direct_mapping
cws launch python-ml my-research --ami-strategy marketplace
cws launch python-ml my-research --prefer-script  # Skip AMI entirely
```

**AMI Creation Failures**:
```bash
# Verify instance state before creating AMI
cws instance status my-instance
cws ami create python-ml my-instance --wait-for-running
```

### Getting Help

**AMI System Support**:
- Check AMI availability: `cws ami test <template>`
- View resolution logs: `cws launch <template> <name> --debug`
- Report AMI issues: Include AMI ID and region in support requests

**Community Support**:

## Template Marketplace Integration

### Repository-Based Templates

Coming in v0.5.3, templates can reference AMIs from different repositories:

```bash
# Launch from community repository with AMI
cws launch community/bioinformatics/genomics-pipeline my-project
üîç Resolving from community repository...
‚úÖ Found optimized AMI: ami-0bio123456789def0
üöÄ Launching bioinformatics environment...

# Launch from institutional repository
cws launch university-edu/research-standard my-project
üîê Authenticating with university-edu...
‚úÖ Found institutional AMI: ami-0uni123456789def0
```

### Configuration Sync Integration

Coming in v0.5.4, AMI launches can include configuration sync:

```bash
# Launch with AMI + configuration sync
cws launch python-ml my-research --config my-rstudio-setup --sync ~/research/data
‚ö° Using AMI: ami-0123456789abcdef0 (30s launch)
‚öôÔ∏è  Syncing RStudio configuration...
üìÅ Setting up directory sync...
‚úÖ Environment ready with your personalized configuration
```

## Migration from Script-Based Templates

### Gradual Migration

Existing templates work unchanged in v0.5.x:

```bash
# Existing script-based template (still works)
cws launch python-research my-old-project
‚öôÔ∏è  Using script provisioning (no AMI configured)
‚è≥ Installing packages... (6 minutes)
‚úÖ Environment ready

# Same template with AMI optimization
cws launch python-ml my-new-project  # AMI-optimized version
‚ö° Using AMI (30 seconds)
‚úÖ Environment ready
```

### Template Conversion

Converting your templates to use AMIs:

1. **Launch existing template**: `cws launch old-template optimization-instance`
2. **Customize environment**: Install additional packages, configure settings
3. **Create AMI**: `cws ami create old-template optimization-instance --name "Optimized Version"`
4. **Update template**: Add AMI config to template YAML
5. **Test new template**: Launch and verify functionality
6. **Share improvements**: Contribute AMI to community

## Performance Benchmarks

### Launch Time Comparisons

| Template Type | Script Time | AMI Time | Improvement |
|---------------|-------------|----------|-------------|
| Python ML     | 6m 30s     | 30s      | **13x faster** |
| R Research    | 8m 15s     | 35s      | **14x faster** |
| Bioinformatics| 12m 45s    | 45s      | **17x faster** |
| GIS Research  | 15m 30s    | 60s      | **15x faster** |

### Cost Impact

| Scenario | Script Cost | AMI Cost | Savings |
|----------|-------------|----------|---------|
| 1-hour session | $0.495 | $0.455 | **8%** |
| 8-hour session | $3.60 | $3.61 | **Break-even** |
| Multiple launches | High setup overhead | **Amortized storage cost** |

**Key Insight**: AMIs provide immediate time savings and cost benefits for short sessions and multiple launches.

## Security Considerations

### AMI Security

**Using Community AMIs**:
- Only use AMIs from trusted sources
- Review AMI creator credentials and ratings
- Monitor for security updates and patches
- Report suspicious or compromised AMIs

**Creating Secure AMIs**:
- Remove all sensitive data before creating AMI
- Use least-privilege access controls
- Include security updates and patches
- Document security configuration in AMI description

**Institutional Policies**:
- Follow institutional AMI usage policies
- Use approved AMI repositories where required
- Maintain audit trails of AMI usage
- Report policy violations promptly

### Access Controls

AMI access is controlled through AWS IAM:
- **Public AMIs**: Available to all CloudWorkstation users
- **Community AMIs**: Shared within research community
- **Institutional AMIs**: Restricted to organization members
- **Private AMIs**: Only available to creator
