## AMI System Deep Dive

### AMI Resolution Strategy

Prism uses intelligent **multi-tier resolution** to find the best deployment method:

1. **Direct Mapping**: Region-specific AMI references (fastest - 30 seconds)
2. **Dynamic Search**: Pattern-based AMI discovery (45 seconds)
3. **Marketplace Integration**: AWS Marketplace AMI lookup (60 seconds)
4. **Cross-Region Intelligence**: Copy AMI from other regions (2 minutes)
5. **Script Fallback**: Traditional installation (5-8 minutes)

### Template AMI Configuration

Templates can now include AMI optimization:

```yaml
# Template with AMI optimization
name: "Python ML (Optimized)"
ami_config:
  strategy: "ami_preferred"  # Try AMI first, fallback to script
  ami_mappings:
    us-east-1: "ami-0123456789abcdef0"
    us-west-2: "ami-0fedcba9876543210"
  fallback_strategy: "script_provisioning"
  preferred_architecture: "arm64"  # Cost optimization
```

### Understanding AMI Strategies

| Strategy | Behavior | Use Case |
|----------|----------|----------|
| `ami_preferred` | Try AMI first, fallback to script | **Recommended**: Balance speed and reliability |
| `ami_required` | AMI only, fail if unavailable | Critical applications requiring exact environments |
| `ami_fallback` | Script first, AMI if script fails | Legacy templates transitioning to AMI |

## Advanced Features

### Cross-Region Deployment

When AMIs aren't available in your region:

```bash
# Automatic cross-region resolution
prism launch python-ml my-research --region ap-south-1
üîç Resolving AMI in ap-south-1...
‚ùå No AMI in ap-south-1
üîÑ Searching fallback regions...
‚úÖ Found AMI in ap-southeast-1: ami-0xyz123456789def0
üìã Cross-region copy required (2 minutes + $0.03)
Continue? [y/N]: y
```

### Performance Optimization

Prism automatically optimizes for:
- **Architecture**: ARM64 preferred for cost savings
- **Instance Types**: Match AMI optimizations to instance families
- **Regional Costs**: Consider data transfer for cross-region copies
- **Launch Speed**: Prioritize faster deployment for interactive work

### Cost Management

Understanding AMI costs:

```bash
# Compare deployment costs
prism launch python-ml my-research --dry-run --show-costs
üí∞ Cost Analysis:

AMI Launch:
  Instance: $0.45/hour (immediate availability)
  AMI Storage: $0.01/month (shared across launches)

Script Launch:
  Instance: $0.45/hour + 6min setup cost ($0.045)
  No storage costs

Recommendation: AMI launch saves time and reduces setup costs
```
