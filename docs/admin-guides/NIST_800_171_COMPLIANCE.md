**What is CUI?**
- Research data funded by federal agencies
- Technical data under export control (ITAR/EAR)
- Proprietary information shared under federal contracts
- Pre-decisional or deliberative information
- Personal information collected under federal programs

**Why NIST 800-171 Matters for Research:**
