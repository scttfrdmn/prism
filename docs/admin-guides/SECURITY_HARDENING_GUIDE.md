- Set appropriate log retention period (90+ days for compliance)
- Secure audit log directory with 0700 permissions
- Implement log rotation and archival processes
- Monitor audit log integrity with checksums

**Production Requirements:**
```bash
# Verify audit directory permissions
chmod 700 ~/.prism/security/audit
chown $(whoami):$(whoami) ~/.prism/security/audit

# Enable audit log monitoring
prism security config  # Verify audit_log_enabled: true
```

### 2. Security Monitoring

**Configuration:**
```yaml
monitoring_enabled: true
monitor_interval: 30s
alert_threshold: MEDIUM
```

**Hardening Steps:**
- Enable real-time security monitoring
- Configure appropriate alert thresholds (MEDIUM for production)
- Set monitoring interval to 30 seconds or less
- Implement automated alerting to security team
- Regular review of security dashboard and metrics

**Production Commands:**
```bash
# Check security monitoring status
prism security status
prism security dashboard

# Monitor security events
prism security correlations
```

### 3. Event Correlation Analysis

**Configuration:**
```yaml
correlation_enabled: true
analysis_interval: 5m
```

**Hardening Steps:**
- Enable advanced security event correlation
- Configure analysis interval (5 minutes recommended)
- Review correlation rules and attack patterns
- Implement custom correlation rules for environment
- Regular analysis of security correlations

### 4. Registry Security

**Configuration:**
```yaml
registry_security_enabled: true
registry_url: "https://registry.prism.io"
```

**Hardening Steps:**
- Enable HMAC-SHA256 request signing
- Configure certificate pinning for registry communication
- Use secure registry endpoints (HTTPS only)
- Regularly update pinned certificate fingerprints
- Monitor registry communication for anomalies

### 5. Keychain Security

**Hardening Steps:**
- Use native keychain providers when available:
  - **macOS**: Security framework with Keychain Services
  - **Windows**: Credential Manager with DPAPI
  - **Linux**: Secret Service with desktop keyring
- Verify keychain provider security level
- Regular keychain validation and diagnostics
- Secure fallback configuration for unsupported platforms

**Validation Commands:**
```bash
# Check keychain status
prism security keychain

# Validate keychain provider
prism security health
```

## üõ°Ô∏è System Hardening

### File System Security

```bash
# Secure Prism directories
chmod 700 ~/.prism
chmod 700 ~/.prism/security
chmod 600 ~/.prism/security/*.json

# Verify file permissions
find ~/.prism -type f -exec chmod 600 {} \;
find ~/.prism -type d -exec chmod 700 {} \;
```

### Network Security

```bash
# Restrict daemon access (example with iptables)
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 8947 -s 127.0.0.1 -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 8947 -j DROP

# Use TLS for all communications
export PRISM_TLS_ENABLED=true
export PRISM_TLS_CERT_PATH=/path/to/cert.pem
export PRISM_TLS_KEY_PATH=/path/to/key.pem
```

### Process Security

```bash
# Run daemon with limited privileges
systemctl edit prism --force
```

Create systemd service configuration:
```ini
[Unit]
Description=Prism Daemon
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=prism
Group=prism
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/cwsd -port 8947
Restart=always
RestartSec=5
PrivateTmp=true
NoNewPrivileges=true
ProtectSystem=strict
ProtectHome=true
ReadWritePaths=/opt/prism

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
