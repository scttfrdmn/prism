# Compliance Framework Support Matrix

## ⚠️ COMPLIANCE DISCLAIMER

**Prism provides technical security controls but DOES NOT guarantee compliance with any regulatory framework.**

This matrix documents technical controls that Prism provides. Use of Prism does not, by itself, constitute compliance. Your institution remains solely responsible for compliance assessments, certifications, and consulting with qualified legal/compliance professionals.

**Always defer to your institution for compliance guidance.** See [COMPLIANCE_DISCLAIMER.md](COMPLIANCE_DISCLAIMER.md) for complete legal notice.
