## Overview

CloudWorkstation is designed with security and compliance as foundational principles, not afterthoughts. This document outlines our security posture, compliance frameworks supported, and roadmap for institutional deployment requirements.

## üéØ Design Philosophy

**Security by Default**:
- Principle of least privilege across all components
- AWS-native security controls (Security Groups, IAM, VPC)
- Encrypted data in transit (TLS) and at rest (EBS encryption)
- Audit logging and monitoring built-in

**Compliance-Ready Architecture**:
- Modular compliance framework supporting multiple standards
- Institutional policy enforcement via template system
- Audit trails for all operations
- Network isolation and access controls

## üìä Current Security Posture

### ‚úÖ Implemented Security Controls

**Infrastructure Security**:
- AWS Security Groups with minimal port exposure (SSH only by default)
- VPC isolation with configurable network topology
- EBS encryption at rest (AWS-managed or customer-managed keys)
- TLS encryption for all API communication
- SSH key-based authentication (no passwords)

**Access Controls**:
- IAM-based AWS resource access (no embedded credentials)
- Profile-based credential isolation
- Research user system with UID/GID consistency
- Role-based project access (Owner/Admin/Member/Viewer)

**Audit & Monitoring**:
- Comprehensive operation logging (all API calls)
- Security event tracking
- Cost and usage monitoring
- Hibernation and state change audit trails

**Data Protection**:
- Encrypted storage (EBS, EFS)
- Secure credential storage (macOS Keychain, encrypted config)
- No plaintext secrets in configuration
- Profile export with encryption

**Network Security**:
- Private subnet deployment support
- Security Group-based firewall rules
- SSH bastion host patterns
- VPC peering and PrivateLink ready

## üè¢ Institutional Security Requirements

### Endpoint Security Agents

**Common Requirements**:
- CrowdStrike Falcon
- Carbon Black
- Microsoft Defender for Endpoint
- Tanium
- Qualys

**CloudWorkstation Approach**:
1. **Template-Based Deployment**: Institutions can create custom templates with required agents
   ```yaml
   name: "University IT Policy - Python ML"
   inherits: ["python-ml"]
   system_packages:
     - crowdstrike-falcon-sensor
   user_data_script: |
     # Install and configure institutional security agent
     curl -s https://university.edu/security/install-agent.sh | bash
   ```

2. **Launch-Time Injection**: Instance launch can include institutional user-data scripts
   ```bash
   cws launch python-ml my-research --user-data-file /path/to/security-setup.sh
   ```

3. **AMI Baking**: Institutions can create custom AMIs with agents pre-installed
   ```bash
   # Custom AMI workflow (future feature)
   cws ami create --from python-ml --with-agents crowdstrike --name python-ml-university-secured
   ```

**Roadmap** (v0.7.0):
- [ ] `--user-data-file` flag for launch command
- [ ] Template `user_data_script` field
- [ ] Documentation for common agent deployments
- [ ] Validation that agents don't conflict with CloudWorkstation

---

### Data Classification & Tagging

**Requirements**:
- CUI marking and handling
- PHI/PII identification
- Export control classification
- Institutional data categories

**CloudWorkstation Approach**:

**Project-Level Classification** (v0.7.0):
```bash
cws project create cancer-research \
  --classification "PHI" \
  --compliance "HIPAA,NIST-800-53" \
  --require-encryption \
  --require-audit-logging
```

**Instance Tagging** (v0.7.0):
```bash
cws launch python-ml research-workstation \
  --project cancer-research \
  --data-classification PHI \
  --tag "IRB-Protocol=2024-123" \
  --tag "PI=jane.smith@university.edu"
```

**Template Policies** (v0.8.0):
```yaml
# Institutional policy: templates/policies/phi-research.yml
name: "PHI Research Policy"
applies_to:
  - data_classification: ["PHI", "PII"]
requirements:
  encryption:
    ebs: required
    efs: required
    kms_key: "arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:123456789012:key/institutional-phi"
  network:
    public_ip: forbidden
    allowed_subnets: ["subnet-abc123"]  # Private subnet only
  access:
    mfa: required
    ip_whitelist: ["10.0.0.0/8"]  # University network only
  audit:
    cloudtrail: required
    log_retention_days: 2555  # 7 years for HIPAA
```

**Roadmap**:
- [ ] Data classification taxonomy
- [ ] Policy enforcement engine
- [ ] Automatic tagging propagation
- [ ] Classification-based access controls

### Network Security Requirements

**Common Institutional Patterns**:
1. **Private Subnet Only**: No public IPs
2. **Bastion/Jump Host**: SSH through institutional gateway
3. **VPN Required**: Access only through institutional VPN
4. **IP Whitelisting**: Restricted to campus networks
5. **Intrusion Detection**: IDS/IPS integration

**CloudWorkstation Support**:

**Current** (v0.5.x):
```bash
# Private subnet deployment
cws launch python-ml research \
  --subnet subnet-private123 \
  --no-public-ip \
  --security-group sg-institutional

# Bastion host pattern (manual SSH configuration)
ssh -J bastion.university.edu cws-research-instance
```

**Enhanced** (v0.7.0):
```bash
# Profile-based network policy
cws profile create university-secure \
  --network-policy institutional-private \
  --bastion bastion.university.edu \
  --require-vpn

cws launch python-ml research --profile university-secure
# ‚Üë Automatically enforces: private subnet, bastion host, VPN check
```

**Roadmap**:
- [ ] Network policy templates
- [ ] VPN connectivity verification
- [ ] IDS/IPS integration hooks

## üîê Authentication & Access Control

### Single Sign-On (SSO) Integration

**Requirements**:
- SAML 2.0 (Shibboleth, Azure AD, Okta)
- OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect
- LDAP / Active Directory
- Duo / MFA enforcement

**CloudWorkstation Architecture**:

**Current** (v0.5.x):
- AWS IAM-based authentication
- Profile-based credential management
- SSH key-based instance access

**Planned** (v0.6.0 - Phase 6):
```bash
# SSO configuration
cws auth configure \
  --provider "University SAML" \
  --idp-url "https://sso.university.edu/saml" \
  --entity-id "cloudworkstation" \
  --mfa-required

# User authentication flow
cws login
# ‚Üë Opens browser, authenticates via university SSO, stores temporary credentials
```

**Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**:
```bash
# Profile-level MFA requirement
cws profile create research-secure \
  --require-mfa \
  --mfa-device arn:aws:iam::123456789012:mfa/jane.smith

# Instance access with MFA
cws connect my-research
# ‚Üë Prompts for MFA token before establishing SSH connection
```

**Roadmap**:
- [ ] SAML 2.0 identity provider integration
- [ ] OAuth/OIDC support (Okta, Azure AD, Google)
- [ ] LDAP/Active Directory authentication
- [ ] MFA enforcement for sensitive operations
- [ ] Session management and timeouts

---

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

**Current** (v0.5.x):
- Project roles: Owner, Admin, Member, Viewer
- Profile-based AWS credential isolation

**Enhanced** (v0.7.0):
```yaml
# Institutional RBAC policy
roles:
  research-faculty:
    permissions:
      - instances:launch
      - instances:stop
      - instances:connect
      - projects:create
    constraints:
      max_instances: 10
      max_cost_per_month: 5000
      allowed_templates: ["python-ml", "r-research"]

  research-student:
    permissions:
      - instances:connect  # Read-only access to assigned instances
      - projects:view
    constraints:
      max_instances: 2
      max_cost_per_month: 200
      allowed_templates: ["python-ml"]

  research-admin:
    permissions:
      - "*"  # Full access
    constraints: {}
```

**Application**:
```bash
# Assign roles to users
cws user create jane.smith@university.edu \
  --role research-faculty \
  --department "Computer Science"

# Role-based template access
cws templates list
# ‚Üë Shows only templates allowed for user's role
```
