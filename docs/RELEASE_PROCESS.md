## Pre-Release Preparation

### 1. Code Quality Assurance

Before starting the release process, ensure all code changes are complete and tested:

```bash
# Run comprehensive test suite
make test

# Build and test all components
make build

# Run any specific test suites (example from v0.4.6)
cd cmd/cws-gui/frontend
npm run build
npx vitest run src/App.behavior.test.tsx --reporter=verbose

# Verify TUI functionality
./bin/cws tui

# Verify GUI functionality
./bin/cws-gui

# Verify CLI functionality
./bin/cws templates
./bin/cws list
```

### 2. Documentation Updates

Ensure all documentation reflects the new features and changes:

- Update README.md if needed
- Update CHANGELOG.md with new version details
- Review and update any relevant documentation files
- Create comprehensive release notes (see example below)

### 3. Clean Working Directory

Ensure your working directory is clean and all changes are committed:

```bash
git status
# Should show no uncommitted changes

git log --oneline -10
# Review recent commits to ensure everything is included
```

## Version Management

### 1. Update Version Files

CloudWorkstation uses several files that need version updates:

**pkg/version/version.go:**
```go
package version

// Version is the current version of the CLI
const Version = "0.4.6"  // Update this value
```

**Makefile:**
```makefile
VERSION := 0.4.6  # Update this value
```

### 2. Version Update Commands

```bash
# Update version in pkg/version/version.go
sed -i '' 's/const Version = ".*"/const Version = "0.4.6"/' pkg/version/version.go

# Update version in Makefile
sed -i '' 's/VERSION := .*/VERSION := 0.4.6/' Makefile

# Verify updates
grep -n "Version.*=" pkg/version/version.go
grep -n "VERSION :=" Makefile
```

### 3. Commit Version Changes

```bash
git add pkg/version/version.go Makefile
git commit -m "ðŸ“¦ RELEASE: Update version to v0.4.6"
git push origin main
```

## Cross-Platform Build Process

### 1. Clean Build Environment

```bash
# Clean previous builds
make clean
rm -rf bin/ dist/
```

### 2. Cross-Platform Compilation

CloudWorkstation supports multiple platforms and architectures:

```bash
# Build for all platforms
make cross-compile

# This creates binaries for:
# - darwin/amd64 (macOS Intel)
# - darwin/arm64 (macOS Apple Silicon)
# - linux/amd64 (Linux x86_64)
# - linux/arm64 (Linux ARM64)
# - windows/amd64 (Windows x86_64)
```

### 3. Manual Cross-Compilation (if needed)

```bash
# macOS Intel
GOOS=darwin GOARCH=amd64 go build -ldflags "-X github.com/scttfrdmn/cloudworkstation/pkg/version.Version=0.4.6" -o bin/release/darwin-amd64/cws ./cmd/cws
GOOS=darwin GOARCH=amd64 go build -ldflags "-X github.com/scttfrdmn/cloudworkstation/pkg/version.Version=0.4.6" -o bin/release/darwin-amd64/cwsd ./cmd/cwsd

# macOS Apple Silicon
GOOS=darwin GOARCH=arm64 go build -ldflags "-X github.com/scttfrdmn/cloudworkstation/pkg/version.Version=0.4.6" -o bin/release/darwin-arm64/cws ./cmd/cws
GOOS=darwin GOARCH=arm64 go build -ldflags "-X github.com/scttfrdmn/cloudworkstation/pkg/version.Version=0.4.6" -o bin/release/darwin-arm64/cwsd ./cmd/cwsd

# Linux x86_64
GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -ldflags "-X github.com/scttfrdmn/cloudworkstation/pkg/version.Version=0.4.6" -o bin/release/linux-amd64/cws ./cmd/cws
GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -ldflags "-X github.com/scttfrdmn/cloudworkstation/pkg/version.Version=0.4.6" -o bin/release/linux-amd64/cwsd ./cmd/cwsd

# Linux ARM64
GOOS=linux GOARCH=arm64 go build -ldflags "-X github.com/scttfrdmn/cloudworkstation/pkg/version.Version=0.4.6" -o bin/release/linux-arm64/cws ./cmd/cws
GOOS=linux GOARCH=arm64 go build -ldflags "-X github.com/scttfrdmn/cloudworkstation/pkg/version.Version=0.4.6" -o bin/release/linux-arm64/cwsd ./cmd/cwsd

# Windows x86_64
GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 go build -ldflags "-X github.com/scttfrdmn/cloudworkstation/pkg/version.Version=0.4.6" -o bin/release/windows-amd64/cws.exe ./cmd/cws
GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 go build -ldflags "-X github.com/scttfrdmn/cloudworkstation/pkg/version.Version=0.4.6" -o bin/release/windows-amd64/cwsd.exe ./cmd/cwsd
```

### 4. GUI Build Process (Platform-Specific)

If including GUI components, build them separately:

```bash
# Build GUI (requires Fyne and platform-specific dependencies)
go build -o bin/release/darwin-amd64/cws-gui ./cmd/cws-gui
go build -o bin/release/darwin-arm64/cws-gui ./cmd/cws-gui
# Note: GUI may not be available on all platforms
```

## Release Artifact Creation

### 1. Create Distribution Directory

```bash
mkdir -p dist/v0.4.6
```

### 2. Package Platform Archives

Create compressed archives for each platform:

```bash
# macOS Intel
cd bin/release/darwin-amd64
tar -czf ../../../dist/v0.4.6/cloudworkstation-v0.4.6-darwin-amd64.tar.gz cws cwsd
cd ../../..

# macOS Apple Silicon
cd bin/release/darwin-arm64
tar -czf ../../../dist/v0.4.6/cloudworkstation-v0.4.6-darwin-arm64.tar.gz cws cwsd
cd ../../..

# Linux x86_64
cd bin/release/linux-amd64
tar -czf ../../../dist/v0.4.6/cloudworkstation-v0.4.6-linux-amd64.tar.gz cws cwsd
cd ../../..

# Linux ARM64
cd bin/release/linux-arm64
tar -czf ../../../dist/v0.4.6/cloudworkstation-v0.4.6-linux-arm64.tar.gz cws cwsd
cd ../../..

# Windows x86_64
cd bin/release/windows-amd64
zip -r ../../../dist/v0.4.6/cloudworkstation-v0.4.6-windows-amd64.zip cws.exe cwsd.exe
cd ../../..
```

### 3. Generate Checksums

Create SHA256 checksums for all archives:

```bash
cd dist/v0.4.6
shasum -a 256 *.tar.gz *.zip > checksums.txt
cd ../..

# Verify checksums file
cat dist/v0.4.6/checksums.txt
```

### 4. Create Release Notes

Create comprehensive release notes (example from v0.4.6):

```bash
cat > dist/v0.4.6/RELEASE_NOTES.md << 'EOF'
