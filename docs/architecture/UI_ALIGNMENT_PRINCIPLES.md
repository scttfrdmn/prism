# CloudWorkstation UI Alignment Principles

## Overview

This document outlines the principles for maintaining alignment between the Terminal User Interface (TUI) and Graphical User Interface (GUI) implementations of CloudWorkstation. Maintaining consistency across interfaces ensures a coherent user experience regardless of which interface users choose.

## Core Principles

### 1. Shared API Client Architecture

- Both TUI and GUI must use the same context-aware API client
- Common response types and data structures
- Consistent error handling patterns
- Shared authentication and connection management

### 2. Navigation Structure Consistency

- Maintain the same primary navigation categories:
  - Dashboard - Overview and summary information
  - Instances - Instance management
  - Templates - Template browsing and launching
  - Storage - Volume management
  - Settings - Configuration options
- Preserve consistent tab/section ordering

### 3. Information Presentation

- Display the same core information in both interfaces
- Maintain consistent terminology across interfaces
- Use similar visual indicators (colors, status icons)
- Present costs and resource metrics in the same format

### 4. Feature Parity

- All core functionality must be available in both interfaces
- Power user features may have different implementations but equivalent capabilities
- No interface-exclusive features except those inherent to the UI type
- New features should be designed with both interfaces in mind

### 5. State Management

- Unified state handling for instances, templates, volumes
- Shared configuration and preferences
- Consistent background operations (launch, delete, etc.)
- Synchronized refresh rates and data staleness handling

### 6. User Interaction Patterns

- Equivalent keyboard shortcuts where applicable
- Similar workflow steps for common operations
- Consistent confirmation patterns for destructive actions
- Shared search and filtering capabilities

### 7. Notification System

- Common notification levels (success, error, info)
- Consistent messaging format and style
- Similar timeout and dismissal behaviors
- Equivalent progress indicators for long-running operations

## Implementation Strategy

### Development Process

1. Design features considering both interfaces from the start
2. Implement shared API client components first
3. Maintain TUI as reference implementation for GUI development
4. Review UI changes for cross-interface consistency

### Testing Approach

1. Feature acceptance criteria must include both interfaces
2. Test equivalent workflows in both TUI and GUI
3. Verify consistent information display and behavior
4. Validate shared state management works correctly

### Documentation Guidelines

1. Document features with examples from both interfaces
2. Maintain parallel user guides for TUI and GUI
3. Use consistent terminology throughout documentation
4. Highlight interface-specific nuances where necessary

## Transition Strategy

As CloudWorkstation evolves to include the GUI in version 0.4.1, maintain the TUI as the reference implementation. The GUI should adopt and build upon patterns established in the TUI while leveraging graphical capabilities for enhanced usability.

## Success Metrics

- Users can switch seamlessly between interfaces without relearning workflows
- Documentation applies accurately to both interfaces
- Feature releases maintain parity across interfaces
- Support questions don't reveal confusion between interfaces
