    s += <<~EOS
      
      🚀 Quick Start:
        cws profiles add personal research --aws-profile aws --region us-west-2
        cws profiles switch personal
        cws launch "Python Machine Learning (Simplified)" my-project
        
      📚 Documentation:
        cws help                    # Full command reference (Cobra CLI)
        cws templates               # List available templates
        cws daemon status           # Check daemon status
        
      🔧 Service Management (Auto-Start on Boot):
        brew services start cloudworkstation   # Auto-start daemon with Homebrew
        brew services stop cloudworkstation    # Stop daemon service
        brew services restart cloudworkstation # Restart daemon service
      
      🛡️ Version 0.4.4 Security Update:
        Web interfaces (Jupyter, RStudio) now require SSH port forwarding for security.
        Example: ssh -L 8888:localhost:8888 user@instance
        
        This prevents internet exposure while maintaining full functionality.
        
      Note: Version 0.4.4 includes enhanced security and prebuilt binaries for fast installation.
