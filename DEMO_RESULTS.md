## ðŸŽ¯ Key Demo Highlights

### 1. Zero-Configuration Experience
```bash
# Templates work out-of-the-box
./bin/cws templates list

# Template details with cost estimation
./bin/cws templates info "Python Machine Learning (Simplified)"
```

### 2. Template Inheritance System
```bash
# Base template: Rocky Linux 9 Base (system tools + rocky user)
# Stacked template: Rocky Linux 9 + Conda Stack (inherits base + adds conda + datascientist user)
./bin/cws templates info "Rocky Linux 9 + Conda Stack"
```

### 3. Professional API Access
```bash
# REST API on port 8947
curl http://localhost:8947/api/v1/templates | jq 'keys'
```

### 4. Package Management Integration
```bash
# Homebrew tap working
brew search cloudworkstation
# â†’ scttfrdmn/cloudworkstation/cloudworkstation
```

### 5. Enterprise Features (Simulated)
- Project-based organization with budget management
- Hibernation policies for cost optimization
- Multi-user collaboration with role-based access
- Real-time cost tracking and analytics
