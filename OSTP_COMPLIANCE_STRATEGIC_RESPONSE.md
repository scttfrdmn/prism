# CloudWorkstation: Strategic Response to OSTP Compliance Feedback

## Executive Summary

Your feedback perfectly captures CloudWorkstation's current position as a strong foundation that needs strategic evolution to become a complete OSTP compliance solution. You're right that we're **70% of the way there** - we have the compute foundation, but need to add the compliance automation and data workflow integration that transforms it from a "better way to launch instances" into a "complete research solution."

This document outlines our strategic response to bridge that gap and position CloudWorkstation as the cornerstone of AWS's higher education research portfolio.

#### **Native Repository Connectors**
```bash
# Launch with automatic repository binding
cws launch r-research metabolomics-study \
  --repository zenodo \
  --project-doi 10.5281/zenodo.7123456 \
  --data-plan metabolomics-dmp.json

# Automatic data publishing during analysis
cws publish-data analysis-results \
  --repository dryad \
  --embargo 12-months \
  --license CC-BY-4.0
```

**Features**:
- **Pre-configured Repository APIs**: Zenodo, Dryad, FigShare, institutional dSpace/iRODS
- **Automatic DOI Minting**: Generate DOIs for computational outputs during analysis
- **Metadata Capture**: Automatic provenance tracking for all analysis steps
- **ORCID Integration**: Link all outputs to researcher identifiers

#### **Data Management Plan Enforcement**
```bash
# Launch with DMP validation
cws launch python-ml genomics-analysis \
  --dmp genomics-dmp.json \
  --validate-compliance

# Automatic compliance checking
cws compliance-check my-analysis
# → Validates data handling against registered DMP
# → Checks export control requirements
# → Ensures proper data classification
```

### **2. Compliance Automation Framework**

#### **Built-in OSTP Element Tracking**
- **Element 1-2 (Data Types/Standards)**: Template-level metadata capture
- **Element 3 (Metadata)**: Automatic schema-based metadata generation
- **Element 4-5 (Access/Preservation)**: Repository integration with retention policies
- **Element 6 (Oversight)**: Real-time compliance dashboards for PIs

#### **Export Control Integration**
```bash
# Controlled data handling
cws launch secure-research controlled-materials-study \
  --classification ITAR \
  --clearance-required \
  --audit-level high

# Automatic classification validation
cws data-classify input-dataset.xlsx
# → Scans for controlled technology keywords
# → Applies appropriate security controls
# → Logs all access for audit trail
```

### **3. Multi-Institutional Collaboration Platform**

#### **Consortium Resource Sharing**
```bash
# Cross-institutional project creation
cws consortium create multi-site-clinical-trial \
  --institutions "stanford,mit,ucsf" \
  --lead-institution stanford \
  --cost-sharing equal

# Federated resource access
cws launch r-research site-analysis \
  --consortium multi-site-clinical-trial \
  --institution mit \
  --data-access stanford:/shared/clinical-data
```

**Features**:
- **Federated Identity**: Cross-institutional SSO with InCommon/eduGAIN
- **Cost Allocation**: Automatic billing distribution across institutions
- **Data Sovereignty**: Respect institutional data residency requirements
- **Shared Governance**: Multi-institutional project approval workflows

  metadata_schema: "datacite"
  automatic_doi: true
  orcid_required: true
compliance:
  dmp_validation: true
  export_control_scan: true
  audit_level: "standard"
```

#### **CLI Extension**
Add compliance commands to existing CLI:

```bash
# Extend existing project commands
cws project create brain-study --ostp-compliant \
  --repository zenodo \
  --dmp brain-study-dmp.json

# New compliance-specific commands
cws compliance validate my-analysis
cws repository publish analysis-results --embargo 6-months
cws metadata export --format datacite
```

### **Phase 6B: Compliance Dashboard (Months 4-6)**

#### **Web Interface for PIs**
Build on existing daemon architecture to add compliance management:

```

```

**Features**:
- **Real-time Compliance Status**: Dashboard showing OSTP element compliance
- **Grant Integration**: Link projects to NSF/NIH award numbers
- **Audit Reports**: Automated reports for program officers
- **Multi-Project Overview**: Institution-level compliance tracking

### **Phase 6C: Advanced Workflows (Months 7-9)**

#### **Template Marketplace Evolution**
Transform existing template marketplace into compliance accelerator:

- **OSTP-Certified Templates**: Pre-validated workflows for common research patterns
- **Domain-Specific Compliance**: Templates for NIH, NSF, DOE-specific requirements
- **Institutional Templates**: University-customized compliance workflows

#### **AI-Powered Compliance Assistant**
```bash
# Intelligent compliance guidance
cws ai suggest-compliance \
  --grant-type NIH-R01 \
  --data-type genomics \
  --collaboration-type multi-institutional

# Automatic compliance remediation
cws ai fix-compliance my-analysis
# → Suggests missing metadata fields
# → Recommends appropriate repositories
# → Identifies potential export control issues
```
