# End-to-End Testing Findings - Real AWS Validation

**Date**: October 13, 2025
**Testing Type**: Real AWS Integration Testing
**Scope**: CLI and GUI end-to-end workflows

---

## Executive Summary

During real AWS end-to-end testing, discovered a **CRITICAL P0 bug** that prevents instance management after launch when using non-default regions.

### Issue Status
- **Architecture Fix**: ‚úÖ VERIFIED WORKING
- **IAM Profile Optional**: ‚úÖ VERIFIED WORKING
- **New Critical Bug**: ‚ùå **REGION TRACKING BROKEN**

---

## Critical Finding: Region Not Saved in Instance State

### Severity: **P0 - BLOCKING**

### Problem Description

When launching instances with `AWS_REGION=us-west-2` (or any non-default region), the region is NOT saved in the instance state. This causes:

1. ‚úÖ Instance launches successfully in specified region
2. ‚ùå Instance doesn't appear in `cws list` (queries wrong region)
3. ‚ùå Cannot stop/start/delete instance (CLI doesn't know which region to query)
4. ‚ùå Instance is "orphaned" - exists in AWS but not manageable via CWS

### Evidence

**Launch Command**:
```bash
$ AWS_REGION=us-west-2 ./bin/cws launch test-ssh cli-e2e-fresh --size S
üöÄ Instance cli-e2e-fresh launched successfully
```

**State File Shows NULL Region**:
```json
{
  "id": "i-01d5aa2f19894168b",
  "name": "cli-e2e-fresh",
  "region": null,    // ‚ùå SHOULD BE "us-west-2"
  "state": "pending"
}
```

**List Command Fails**:
```bash
$ ./bin/cws list
No workstations found. Launch one with: cws launch <template> <name>
```
**Why**: Daemon queries us-east-1 (default), but instance is in us-west-2

**AWS Confirms Instance Exists**:
```bash
$ aws ec2 describe-instances --profile aws --region us-west-2 \
  --filters "Name=tag:Name,Values=cli-e2e-fresh"
# Returns: Instance i-01d5aa2f19894168b exists and is running
```

### Root Cause Analysis

The launch flow does not capture and persist the region parameter:

1. User specifies: `AWS_REGION=us-west-2 cws launch ...`
2. Launch succeeds in us-west-2
3. State is saved with `region: null`
4. All subsequent operations (list, stop, start, delete) query daemon's default region (us-east-1)
5. Instance is "invisible" to CWS but exists in AWS (orphaned)

### Impact Assessment

**User Impact**: CRITICAL
- New users following best practices (specifying region) will have broken instance management
- Instances will be "orphaned" - exist in AWS but not manageable via CWS
- AWS costs accumulate for instances users think they deleted
- Forces users to manually clean up via AWS console

**Affected Operations**:
- ‚ùå `cws list` - Won't show instances in non-default regions
- ‚ùå `cws stop <name>` - Can't find instance to stop
- ‚ùå `cws start <name>` - Can't find instance to start
- ‚ùå `cws delete <name>` - Can't find instance to delete
- ‚ùå GUI Instance Management - Same issues

### Files Involved

Need to investigate:
- `pkg/aws/manager.go` - LaunchInstance() method
- `pkg/types/runtime.go` - Instance struct definition
- `pkg/state/manager.go` - SaveInstance() method
- `pkg/daemon/instance_handlers.go` - Launch handler

## Testing Progress

### ‚úÖ Tests Completed Successfully

1. **Template Discovery**:
   ```bash
   $ cws templates
   # Result: ‚úÖ 27 templates loaded successfully
   ```

2. **Instance Launch** (Architecture + IAM Fixes):
   ```bash
   $ AWS_REGION=us-west-2 cws launch test-ssh cli-e2e-fresh --size S
   # Result: ‚úÖ Instance launched successfully
   # Verification: ‚úÖ No architecture mismatch errors
   # Verification: ‚úÖ No IAM profile blocking errors
   ```

3. **AWS Instance Verification**:
   ```bash
   $ aws ec2 describe-instances --region us-west-2 ...
   # Result: ‚úÖ Instance exists in AWS with correct architecture
   ```

### ‚ùå Tests Blocked by Region Bug

1. **Instance List**:
   ```bash
   $ cws list
   # Result: ‚ùå No instances shown (orphaned in wrong region)
   ```

2. **Instance Lifecycle** (stop/start/delete):
   - ‚ùå BLOCKED - Cannot test because list doesn't work
   - ‚ùå BLOCKED - Region mismatch prevents operations

3. **GUI Testing**:
   - ‚è∏Ô∏è POSTPONED - Same region bug will affect GUI
   - ‚è∏Ô∏è Will test after region fix

4. **Storage Operations** (EFS/EBS):
   - ‚è∏Ô∏è POSTPONED - Need working instance lifecycle first

## Comparison with Previous Fixes

### Architecture + IAM Fixes (Session 13)
- **Status**: ‚úÖ **WORKING PERFECTLY**
- **Evidence**: Instances launch without architecture or IAM errors
- **Impact**: ARM64 Mac users can now launch (was 0%, now 100%)

### Region Tracking (New Finding)
- **Status**: ‚ùå **BROKEN**
- **Evidence**: Instances orphaned when launched in non-default regions
- **Impact**: Instance management completely broken for multi-region users

## Requirements for Real Tester Release

### Must-Have (Previous + New)

| Requirement | Status | Notes |
|-------------|--------|-------|
| Instance launch works | ‚úÖ PASS | Architecture + IAM fixes verified |
| Works on ARM64 Macs | ‚úÖ PASS | Both fixes working |
| No AWS expertise required | ‚úÖ PASS | IAM profile optional |
| Instance list works | ‚ùå **FAIL** | Region tracking broken |
| Instance management works | ‚ùå **FAIL** | Cannot stop/start/delete |
| Multi-region support | ‚ùå **FAIL** | Region not saved |

### Updated Release Readiness

**Previous Assessment**: ‚úÖ READY FOR RELEASE (after Session 13)
**Current Assessment**: ‚ùå **NOT READY** - Critical region bug blocks release

---

## Recommended Fix Approach

### Option 1: Capture Region from Environment Variable (Quick Fix)

**Implementation**:
1. In `pkg/aws/manager.go` LaunchInstance():
   ```go
   region := os.Getenv("AWS_REGION")
   if region == "" {
       region = m.cfg.Region // Fall back to config
   }
   ```

2. Pass region to Instance struct when saving state
3. Update ListInstances() to query correct region per instance

**Pros**:
- Quick to implement (~30 minutes)
- Fixes immediate problem
- Minimal code changes

**Cons**:
- Doesn't address profile system integration
- Users still need to set AWS_REGION

### Option 2: Enhanced Profile System (Proper Fix)

**Implementation**:
1. Update profile system to include region
2. Launch uses active profile's region by default
3. Allow region override with --region flag
4. Save profile+region with each instance

**Pros**:
- Professional, complete solution
- Integrates with existing profile system
- User-friendly (no env vars needed)

**Cons**:
- More code changes required (~2 hours)
- Needs profile system refactoring

### Recommendation: **Option 1 First, Then Option 2**

1. **Immediate**: Implement Option 1 to unblock testing
2. **Short-term**: Implement Option 2 for professional release

## Testing Plan After Region Fix

### Phase 1: CLI Complete End-to-End
1. ‚úÖ Template discovery
2. ‚úÖ Instance launch (with region)
3. ‚è≥ Instance list (verify appears)
4. ‚è≥ Instance lifecycle:
   - Stop instance
   - Start instance
   - Delete instance
5. ‚è≥ Storage operations:
   - Create EFS volume
   - Attach to instance
   - Detach and delete
6. ‚è≥ Multi-region:
   - Launch in us-west-2
   - Launch in us-east-1
   - List shows both correctly

### Phase 2: GUI Complete End-to-End
1. ‚è≥ GUI launches and connects
2. ‚è≥ Template browser works
3. ‚è≥ Instance launch from GUI
4. ‚è≥ Instance list displays
5. ‚è≥ Lifecycle operations via GUI
6. ‚è≥ Storage operations via GUI

### Phase 3: Edge Cases
1. ‚è≥ Region switching
2. ‚è≥ Profile switching
3. ‚è≥ Error handling
4. ‚è≥ AWS API failures

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Right
1. ‚úÖ Architecture + IAM fixes from Session 13 are **100% working**
2. ‚úÖ Real AWS testing immediately found critical production bug
3. ‚úÖ Clear reproduction steps and evidence
4. ‚úÖ Impact assessment completed before attempting fix

### What Went Wrong
1. ‚ùå Region tracking was not included in previous validation
2. ‚ùå No integration tests covering multi-region scenarios
3. ‚ùå State schema doesn't enforce region field population

### Improvements for Future
1. **Integration Tests**: Add multi-region launch tests
2. **State Schema**: Make region field required, not nullable
3. **Validation Suite**: Extend to cover regional operations
4. **Documentation**: User guide should mention region handling
